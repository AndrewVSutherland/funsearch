Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the number of unique remainders when dividing `k` by `n` and the number of multiples of `k` within the range `[1, n]`. This version is more concise and makes small changes to improve the priority calculation.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  remainders = set(k % i for i in range(1, n + 1))
  multiples = sum(i % k == 0 for i in range(1, n + 1))
  return len(remainders) + multiples
```

This version calculates the number of unique remainders when dividing `k` by each integer in the range `[1, n]` and stores them in a set to eliminate duplicates. It also counts the number of multiples of `k` within the same range. The priority is then calculated as the sum of these two values.

To further improve the function, you can consider additional factors that might affect the priority, such as the distribution of remainders or the proximity of multiples to `k`. However, keep in mind that the goal is to make small changes on each iteration, so don't introduce significant changes at once.
