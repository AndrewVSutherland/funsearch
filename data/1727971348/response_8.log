Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the number of unique remainders when dividing `k` by `n` and the number of multiples of `k` less than `n`. This version is shorter and makes a small change from `priority_v0`.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  remainders = set(k % i for i in range(1, n + 1))
  multiples = sum(1 for i in range(1, n // k + 1))
  return len(remainders) * multiples
```

This version calculates the priority as the product of the number of unique remainders and the number of multiples of `k` less than `n`. The `remainders` set stores unique remainders, and the `multiples` variable counts the number of multiples of `k` less than `n`. The result is a float, as required by the decorator `@funsearch.run`.
