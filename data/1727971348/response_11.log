Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[0, n-1]` and the number of remaining possible integers. This version is shorter and makes a small change from `priority_v0`.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  freq = sum(1 for i in range(n) if i % k == 0)  # Frequency of k in [0, n-1]
  remaining = n - k  # Remaining possible integers
  return freq / (remaining + 1)  # Prioritize elements with higher frequency and fewer remaining options
```

This version uses a generator expression to count the frequency of `k` in the range `[0, n-1]`. It then returns a priority value that is the ratio of the frequency to the number of remaining possible integers plus one (to avoid division by zero). This prioritizes elements with higher frequency and fewer remaining options.
