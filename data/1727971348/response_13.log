Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the growth rate of the frequency as `n` increases, making it more suitable for large `n`. This version uses the harmonic number `H(n)` to capture the growth rate.

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v1` using harmonic number for growth rate consideration."""
  freq = sum(1 for i in range(n) if i % k == 0)  # Frequency of k in [0, n-1]
  remaining = n - k  # Remaining possible integers
  H_n = sum(1 / i for i in range(1, n + 1))  # Harmonic number H(n)
  return freq * H_n / (remaining + 1)
```

To keep the code short and maintain the spirit of the provided code, I've made only a small change to incorporate the harmonic number. This change should improve the priority function for large `n` by considering the growth rate of the frequency.
