Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` with a small change to better handle cases where `k` is close to `n`. This version uses a weighted average of frequency and remaining options, giving more weight to frequency when `k` is large.

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v1`."""
  freq = sum(1 for i in range(n) if i % k == 0)  # Frequency of k in [0, n-1]
  remaining = n - k  # Remaining possible integers
  weight = min(1, k / n)  # Weight decreases as k approaches n
  return (weight * freq + (1 - weight) * (remaining + 1)) / (remaining + 1)
```

This version gives more priority to elements with higher frequency when `k` is large (close to `n`), and more priority to elements with fewer remaining options when `k` is small. The weight `min(1, k / n)` ensures that the weight never exceeds 1, and it decreases as `k` approaches `n`.
