Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]` and the number of elements in the Salem-Spencer set. This version uses the `itertools` library to generate all possible subsets of the range `[1, n]` and counts the occurrences of `k` in each subset.

```python
from typing import Set

@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
    # Count occurrences of k in all subsets of [1, n]
    subsets = [set(c) for c in itertools.chain.from_iterable(itertools.combinations(range(1, n + 1), r) for r in range(n + 1))]
    freq_k = sum(k in subset for subset in subsets)

    # Calculate priority based on frequency and number of subsets
    return freq_k / (n ** 0.5 * len(subsets))
```

This version of `priority_v1` makes a small change by considering the frequency of `k` in all possible subsets of the range `[1, n]`. The priority is then calculated as the frequency divided by the square root of `n` and the total number of subsets. This change should improve the priority function without making significant modifications to the original code.
