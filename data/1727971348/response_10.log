Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of each integer in the range `[0, n)` and the difference between `k` and the mean of the range. This version uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each integer.

```python
from collections import Counter

def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  # Count the occurrences of each integer in the range [0, n)
  counts = Counter(range(n))
  # Calculate the mean of the range
  mean = n / 2
  # Calculate the priority as the frequency of k plus a small bonus for being close to the mean
  return counts[k] + (1 - abs(k - mean) / n) * 0.1
```

This version of `priority_v1` makes a small change to the previous version by considering the frequency of `k` and its distance from the mean of the range. The `abs(k - mean) / n` term ensures that the priority is higher for integers closer to the mean, with a maximum bonus of 0.1 when `k` is equal to the mean.
