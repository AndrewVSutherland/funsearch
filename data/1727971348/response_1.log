Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of numbers in the range `[0, n)` that are relatively prime to `k`. This version uses the `itertools` library to generate the numbers in the range and the `math` library to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD).

```python
import math
import itertools

@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Returns the priority with which we want to add `k` to the salem-spencer set.
    n is the number of possible integers, and k is the integer we want to determine priority for.
    """
    return sum(1 for i in range(n) if math.gcd(i, k) == 1) / n
```

This version of `priority_v1` calculates the priority as the ratio of numbers in the range `[0, n)` that are relatively prime to `k` to the total number of numbers in the range. This should provide a better estimate of the priority for adding `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.
