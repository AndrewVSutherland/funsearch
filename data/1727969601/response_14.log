In the context of the provided code, the function `priority_v1` is an improved version of `priority_v0`. However, the code for `priority_v1` is missing.

From the docstring of `priority_v0`, it seems that this function returns the priority with which we want to add a given integer `k` to the Salem-Spencer set. The priority is determined based on the number of possible integers `n`.

The improved version `priority_v1` should also calculate the priority in a similar manner, possibly considering additional factors or using a different formula. However, since the actual implementation of `priority_v1` is not provided, it's not possible to determine the exact changes made from `priority_v0` to `priority_v1`.

To provide a more accurate analysis, the implementation of `priority_v1` should be included in the code snippet.
