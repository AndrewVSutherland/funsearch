Here's an improved version of `priority_v0`. This version decreases the number of iterations by using numpy's built-in operations which are faster than Python's built-in operations.

```python
import numpy as np

def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
    # Create an array of integers from 1 to n
    arr = np.arange(1, n + 1)

    # Create a meshgrid of the array with itself
    i, j = np.meshgrid(arr, arr)

    # Calculate the sum of i and j for each pair
    sums = i + j

    # Exclude the case where i equals j
    sums = sums[i != j]

    # Count the occurrences of each sum
    counts = np.bincount(sums)

    # Return the count of k
    return counts[k] if k < len(counts) else 0
```

This version of the function calculates the count of `k` in a more efficient way. It creates a meshgrid of the array with itself, which generates all possible pairs of `(i, j)`. Then it calculates the sum of each pair, excludes the case where `i` equals `j`, and finally counts the occurrences of each sum using numpy's `bincount` function. This makes the function faster and shorter.
