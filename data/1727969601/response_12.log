It seems like you're working on a function that determines the priority of adding an integer to a Salem-Spencer set. The function `priority_v1` is an improved version of `priority_v0`, but you haven't provided the implementation for `priority_v1`.

Based on your description, it seems like the priority could be based on the size of the integer `k` relative to the total number of possible integers `n`. A simple improvement could be to return the ratio of `k` to `n` as the priority. This would give higher priority to larger numbers, assuming that larger numbers have a higher likelihood of contributing to a large Salem-Spencer progression.

Here's a simple implementation of `priority_v1`:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`. Returns the priority based on the ratio of k to n."""
  return k / n
```

This function returns a value between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates that `k` is equal to `n` and 0 indicates that `k` is 0.

Please note that this is a very basic implementation and may not be suitable for your specific use case. The choice of priority function depends on the specific properties of the Salem-Spencer set and the problem you're trying to solve.
