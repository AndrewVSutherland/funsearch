Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]` and the number of remaining possible integers. I've made small changes to keep the code short and focused on improving the priority function.

```python
from collections import Counter

@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Returns the priority with which we want to add `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.
    n is the number of possible integers, and k is the integer we want to determine priority for.
    """
    # Count the frequency of k in the range [1, n]
    freq = Counter(range(1, n + 1))[k]

    # Calculate the number of remaining possible integers
    remaining = n - k

    # Prioritize elements that are more frequent and have fewer remaining possibilities
    return freq / (remaining + 1)
```

This version of `priority_v1` should provide a better estimate for adding `k` to the Salem-Spencer set, as it considers both the frequency of `k` and the number of remaining possible integers. The division by `remaining + 1` ensures that the priority is always positive and avoids division by zero when `k` is equal to `n`.
