Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the difference between the target number `k` and the average of possible integers `n`. This version also incorporates the idea of penalizing larger numbers to encourage smaller SS progressions.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
    avg = n / 2
    diff = abs(k - avg)
    penalty = (n - k) / n  # Penalize larger numbers
    return diff * (1 - penalty)
```

To further improve the function, we can consider the number of SS progressions that include `k` and penalize numbers that appear in many progressions. Here's `priority_v2` that incorporates this idea:

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v1`."""
    avg = n / 2
    diff = abs(k - avg)
    penalty = (n - k) / n  # Penalize larger numbers

    # Estimate the number of SS progressions that include `k`
    # This is a rough estimate, as we don't know the actual SS progressions yet
    num_progressions = sum(1 for _ in itertools.combinations(range(1, n + 1), 2) if k in range(min(_), max(_) + 1))
    progression_penalty = num_progressions / (n * (n - 1) / 2)  # Normalize by the total number of 2-combinations

    return diff * (1 - penalty) * (1 - progression_penalty)
```

These changes should help improve the priority function, making it more likely to find larger SS progressions. As always, make sure to test these changes thoroughly to ensure they work as expected.
