Here's an iterative improvement of the `priority_vX` functions, focusing on finding large Salem-Spencer progressions. I've made the changes small and kept the code concise. I've also used the `funsearch` decorator to automatically run and compare the functions.

```python
import itertools
import numpy as np
import funsearch

@funsearch.run
def priority_v0(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    return 0.0

def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Adds the number of Salem-Spencer progressions of length 2 containing `k`."""
    return sum(1 for _ in itertools.combinations(range(n), 2) if abs(_[0] - _[1]) % k == 0)

def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Adds the number of Salem-Spencer progressions of length 3 containing `k`."""
    return sum(1 for _ in itertools.combinations(range(n), 3) if abs(_[0] - _[1]) % k == 0 and abs(_[1] - _[2]) % k == 0)

def priority_v3(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Adds the number of Salem-Spencer progressions of length 4 containing `k`, and penalizes progressions with small differences."""
    return sum(1 for _ in itertools.combinations(range(n), 4) if abs(_[0] - _[1]) % k == 0 and abs(_[1] - _[2]) % k == 0 and abs(_[2] - _[3]) % k == 0) - 0.5 * sum(1 for _ in itertools.combinations(range(n), 4) if abs(_[0] - _[1]) % k == 0 and abs(_[1] - _[2]) % k == 0 and abs(_[2] - _[3]) % k == 1)

# You can continue this pattern to create more versions, adding more terms and adjustments as needed.
```

Each version improves upon the previous one by considering longer Salem-Spencer progressions and adding or adjusting terms to better prioritize larger progressions. The `funsearch` decorator will help you compare the performance of these functions automatically.
