Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]` and the number of elements in the Salem-Spencer set. This version uses the `itertools` library to generate the range and `np` for counting frequencies.

```python
import itertools
import numpy as np

@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Returns the priority with which we want to add `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.
    n is the number of possible integers, and k is the integer we want to determine priority for.
    """
    # Count the frequency of k in the range [1, n]
    freq_k = sum(1 for _ in itertools.islice(itertools.count(1), k-1, n+1))

    # Estimate the size of the Salem-Spencer set (assuming it's growing linearly)
    ss_size = min(k, n)

    # Priority is based on the frequency of k and the size of the Salem-Spencer set
    return freq_k / ss_size
```

This version makes a small change by introducing the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]` and using it to calculate the priority. The priority is now inversely proportional to the size of the Salem-Spencer set, encouraging the addition of more frequent elements to the set as it grows.
