Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[0, n)` and the number of elements in the range that are less than `k`. This version is more concise and should provide a better priority value.

```python
from collections import Counter

def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  elements = list(range(n))
  freq = Counter(elements)
  less_than_k = sum(1 for e in elements if e < k)

  return (freq[k] / n) * (1 + less_than_k / (n - 1))
```

This version uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each element in the range `[0, n)`. It then calculates the number of elements less than `k` and uses these values to compute the priority. The priority is a weighted sum of the frequency of `k` and the proportion of elements less than `k`.
