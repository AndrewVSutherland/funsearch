Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[0, n)` and its distance from the middle of the range. This version is shorter and makes small changes to improve the priority calculation.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  freq = np.sum(np.arange(n) == k)  # Frequency of k in [0, n)
  mid = n // 2
  return freq / (abs(k - mid) + 1)
```

This version calculates the frequency of `k` in the range `[0, n)` using NumPy's array comparison. It then calculates the distance from `k` to the middle of the range (`mid`) and adds 1 to avoid division by zero. The priority is the frequency divided by this distance.
