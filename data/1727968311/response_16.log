Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]` and the number of possible pairs `(k, k+i)` that can be formed with `k` as the first element. This version uses the `itertools.combinations` function to count the number of pairs.

```python
from collections import Counter

@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
    freq = Counter(range(1, n+1)).get(k, 0)
    pairs = sum(1 for _ in itertools.combinations(range(k, n+1), 2))
    return freq * pairs
```

This version makes a small change by introducing the frequency of `k` and the number of possible pairs, which should improve the priority calculation. The code is also kept short as requested.
