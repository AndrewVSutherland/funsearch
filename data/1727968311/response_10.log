Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range [0, n) and the number of multiples of `k` within that range. This version is shorter and makes small changes to improve the priority calculation.

```python
from collections import Counter

@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Returns the priority with which we want to add `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.
    n is the number of possible integers, and k is the integer we want to determine priority for.
    """
    # Count the frequency of multiples of k in the range [0, n)
    multiples = [i for i in range(n) if i % k == 0]
    freq = Counter(multiples)

    # Calculate priority as the sum of frequencies of multiples of k, divided by n
    priority = sum(freq.values()) / n

    return priority
```

This version of `priority_v1` should provide a better estimate of the priority for adding `k` to the Salem-Spencer set, as it considers the frequency of multiples of `k` within the given range. The code is also shorter and more concise than the original `priority_v0` function.
