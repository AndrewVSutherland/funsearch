Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the number of unique remainders when dividing `k` by `n`, as well as the number of multiples of `k` less than `n`. This version is shorter and makes small changes to improve the priority calculation.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  remainders = set((k % i) for i in range(1, n + 1))
  multiples = sum(1 for i in range(1, n) if i % k == 0)
  return len(remainders) + multiples
```

This version calculates the set of unique remainders when dividing `k` by all integers from 1 to `n`, and counts the number of multiples of `k` less than `n`. The priority is then the sum of these two values. This approach should improve the priority calculation compared to `priority_v0`.
