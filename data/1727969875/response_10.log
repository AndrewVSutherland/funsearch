Here is a simple implementation of priority_v1 which returns the reciprocal of the square of k. This way, smaller k values will have a higher priority.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`.
  n is the number of possible integers, and k is the integer we want to determine priority for.
  """
  if k != 0:
    return 1.0 / (k ** 2)
  else:
    return 0.0
```

This implementation assumes that k is a non-negative integer, and that larger values of k are less desirable. The priority of k is inversely proportional to its square, meaning that smaller k values have a higher priority. If k is zero, the priority is zero, as there is no value to add to the Salem-Spencer set.
