Here's an improved version of `priority_v0` that considers the number of remaining possible integers `n` and the current integer `k`. The priority is calculated as the difference between `k` and the average of the remaining possible integers. This means that larger integers will have a higher priority if they are closer to the average of the remaining possible integers.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  return k - (n + 1) / 2
```

This is a simple and efficient way to improve the priority calculation. However, it might not be the best strategy for finding large SS progressions, as it does not consider the specific structure of the Salem-Spencer set or the problem's constraints. More sophisticated strategies might be needed for this particular problem.
