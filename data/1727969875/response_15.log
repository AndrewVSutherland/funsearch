It appears that there was an error in the provided code snippet, as the function `priority_v1` was declared but not defined. However, I can provide a basic example of how this function might be improved upon the `priority_v0` function.

In this example, I'll assume that the priority is inversely proportional to the value of `k`, up to a certain limit (`n`). This is just a simple example to demonstrate the concept.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`. Priority is inversely proportional to `k`."""
  if k > n:  # Assuming `k` should not exceed `n`
    return 0.0
  else:
    return 1 / k
```

In this version of the function, the priority decreases as `k` increases, which seems like a reasonable approach based on the problem description. However, the exact formula for calculating priority might need to be adjusted based on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem.
