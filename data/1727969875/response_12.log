Sure, I'd be happy to help you improve your `priority_v1` function. However, without more context or specific requirements, it's difficult to provide a meaningful improvement.

Based on your comment, it seems like you're working with Salem-Spencer sets and you're trying to determine a priority for adding an integer `k` to the set. The priority is based on the total number of possible integers `n`.

Here's a simple improvement that might be useful: you could prioritize integers that are closer to the middle of the range of possible integers. This is based on the assumption that integers in the middle are likely to be part of larger progressions.

Here's a possible implementation:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`. Prioritizes integers closer to the middle of the range."""
  middle = n / 2
  distance_from_middle = abs(k - middle)
  return 1 / (distance_from_middle + 1)  # the closer to the middle, the higher the priority
```

This function calculates the distance of `k` from the middle of the range (`n / 2`), and returns a priority that is inversely proportional to this distance. This means that numbers closer to the middle will have a higher priority. The `+1` in the denominator is to avoid division by zero when `k` is exactly in the middle.
