In the provided code, there is a function `priority_v0` that currently returns a constant value of 0.0. To improve this, I propose a new function `priority_v1` that calculates the priority based on the relative position of the integer `k` in the range of possible integers `n`. The priority will be higher for integers that are closer to the middle of the range.

Here's the code for `priority_v1`:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`.

    Args:
        k (int): The integer for which to calculate the priority.
        n (int): The number of possible integers.

    Returns:
        float: The priority of the integer `k`.
    """
    middle = n // 2
    distance_from_middle = abs(k - middle)
    priority = 1 - (distance_from_middle / middle)
    return priority
```

In this code, `middle` is the integer that represents the middle of the range. `distance_from_middle` is the absolute difference between `k` and `middle`. The priority is calculated as `1 - (distance_from_middle / middle)`, which means that integers closer to the middle will have a higher priority. Integers on the edges of the range will have a lower priority.

To clarify, the priority is calculated as follows:

- If `k` is equal to `middle`, the priority is 1.0.
- If `k` is equal to an edge of the range (either 0 or `n - 1`), the priority is 0.0.
- For all other `k`, the priority is a value between 0.0 and 1.0, with integers closer to the middle having a priority closer to 1.0.
