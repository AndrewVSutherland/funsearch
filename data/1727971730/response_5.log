Here is an improved version of the `priority_v0` function. The priority now is calculated as the negative of the integer's value. This would result in higher priority for smaller integers, thus enabling larger SS progressions.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`. The priority now is calculated as the negative of the integer's value."""
  return k * -1
```

This function now prioritizes smaller integers, which would help in creating larger SS progressions. However, this is a very basic improvement and might not yield optimal results for all scenarios. Further improvements could be made based on more specific requirements or constraints.
