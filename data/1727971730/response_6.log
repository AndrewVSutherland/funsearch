I've made a small change to the `priority_v1` function. Now it returns a priority for a given integer `k` in the range of possible integers `n`. The priority is calculated as a ratio of the square of `k` to the product of `n` and the square of `n`. This way, the function prioritizes larger values of `k` within the given range `n`. If `n` is zero, the function returns 0 to avoid division by zero.
