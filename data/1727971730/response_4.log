    """Improved version of `priority_v0`.

    In this version, we use the concept of "large SS progressions" which are sequences of integers
    with specific differences between consecutive elements. The priority is based on the length of
    the longest "large SS progression" that can be formed using the integer `k` as the last element.

    The priority is calculated as the sum of the lengths of all "large SS progressions" that can be
    formed using `k` as the last element, where the length of a progression is the number of
    elements in it.
