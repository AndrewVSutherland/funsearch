It seems like you're working on a function that calculates a priority value for a given integer `k` in a context related to the Salem-Spencer set, where `n` is the total number of possible integers.

Here's a simple improvement to your `priority_v1` function that uses the ratio of `k` to `n` as a basis for the priority:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  return k / n
```

This function will return a value between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates that `k` is equal to `n` (the maximum possible value), and 0 indicates that `k` is 0. This could be a reasonable way to prioritize which integers to add to the Salem-Spencer set based on their size relative to the total number of possible integers.
