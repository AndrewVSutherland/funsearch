Here is a simple improvement that takes into account the size of the number and its relationship to the total number of possible integers.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  # Normalize k to be between 0 and 1
  normalized_k = k / n
  # Give higher priority to numbers closer to 0.5,
  # which are likely to have more divisors and therefore be more interesting.
  return 1.0 - abs(normalized_k - 0.5)
```

This priority function gives higher priority to numbers that are closer to the middle of the range, as these numbers are more likely to have more divisors and therefore be more interesting for SS progressions.

This function could be improved further by considering other properties of the numbers, such as their prime factorization, or by incorporating more information about the specific SS progressions we are interested in. However, these improvements would likely make the function more complex and less general.
