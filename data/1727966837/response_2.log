Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]` and the number of elements already in the Salem-Spencer set. I've made small changes to keep the code short and focused on improving the priority function.

```python
from collections import Counter

@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int, ss_set: set) -> float:
    """Returns the priority with which we want to add `k` to the salem-spencer set `ss_set`.
    n is the number of possible integers, and k is the integer we want to determine priority for.
    ss_set is the current Salem-Spencer set.
    """
    freq = Counter(range(1, n + 1)).get(k, 0)
    return freq / (n * len(ss_set) + 1)
```

This version of `priority_v1` considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]` and divides it by the product of `n` and the current size of the Salem-Spencer set, plus one. This ensures that the priority is always between 0 and 1, with higher frequencies and smaller set sizes resulting in higher priorities.
