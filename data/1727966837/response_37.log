Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]` and its distance from the middle of the range. This version is shorter and makes a small change from `priority_v0`.

```python
from collections import Counter

@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Returns the priority with which we want to add `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.
    n is the number of possible integers, and k is the integer we want to determine priority for.
    """
    freq = Counter(range(1, n + 1)).get(k, 0)  # Frequency of k in the range [1, n]
    mid = n // 2 + 1  # Middle of the range [1, n]
    return (freq / n) * (abs(k - mid) / (mid - 1))  # Priority calculation
```

This version uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to efficiently count the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]`. The priority is calculated as the product of the frequency ratio and the normalized distance from the middle of the range.
