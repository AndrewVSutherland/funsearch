Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[0, n)` and the number of remaining elements to be added to the Salem-Spencer set. I've made small changes to keep the code short and focused on improving the priority calculation.

```python
from collections import Counter

@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Returns the priority with which we want to add `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.
    n is the number of possible integers, and k is the integer we want to determine priority for.
    """
    # Count the frequency of each integer in the range [0, n)
    freq = Counter(range(n))

    # Calculate the number of remaining elements to be added to the Salem-Spencer set
    remaining = n - sum(freq.values())

    # Prioritize elements that are frequent and have many remaining elements to be added
    return freq[k] * remaining
```

This version of `priority_v1` should provide a better estimate for adding `k` to the Salem-Spencer set, as it considers both the frequency of `k` and the number of remaining elements to be added. To further improve the priority calculation, you can consider additional factors, such as the distribution of frequencies or the growth rate of remaining elements.
