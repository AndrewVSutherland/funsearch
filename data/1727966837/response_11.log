Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the first `n` integers. This version uses the fact that Salem-Spencer sets are based on the frequency of integers in the set. The code is kept short and only small changes are made compared to `priority_v0`.

```python
import itertools
import numpy as np

@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Returns the priority with which we want to add `k` to the salem-spencer set.
    n is the number of possible integers, and k is the integer we want to determine priority for.
    """
    freq = sum(1 for i in range(1, n+1) if i % k == 0)
    return freq / n
```

This version calculates the frequency of `k` in the first `n` integers using a generator expression and the `sum` function. The priority is then the frequency divided by `n`, giving a value between 0 and 1.
