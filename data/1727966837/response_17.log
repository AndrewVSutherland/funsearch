Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[0, n)` and the number of remaining possible integers. The improvement is small, but it's a step towards a more informed priority calculation.

```python
from collections import Counter

@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Returns the priority with which we want to add `k` to the salem-spencer set.
  n is the number of possible integers, and k is the integer we want to determine priority for.
  """
  # Count the frequency of each integer in the range [0, n)
  freq = Counter(range(n))

  # Calculate priority based on frequency and remaining possible integers
  priority = freq[k] / n * (n - k)

  return priority
```

This version of `priority_v1` calculates the priority as the product of the frequency of `k` and the ratio of remaining possible integers to the total number of possible integers. This way, it favors integers that appear more frequently and are closer to the end of the range.
