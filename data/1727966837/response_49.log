Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]` and the number of elements in the Salem-Spencer set that are less than or equal to `k`. This version uses the `itertools` and `numpy` libraries to efficiently count frequencies and generate ranges.

```python
import itertools
import numpy as np

@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Returns the priority with which we want to add `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.
    n is the number of possible integers, and k is the integer we want to determine priority for.
    """
    # Count the frequency of k in the range [1, n]
    freq = np.sum(np.arange(1, n + 1) == k)

    # Generate the Salem-Spencer set up to k
    ssp_set = set(itertools.islice(itertools.count(1), k))

    # Calculate the priority as the frequency of k divided by the number of elements in the SSP set that are <= k
    return freq / (k - len(ssp_set) + 1)
```

This version of `priority_v1` makes small changes to improve the priority calculation by considering the frequency of `k` and the size of the Salem-Spencer set up to `k`. The code is also kept short and efficient by utilizing `numpy` and `itertools` functions.
