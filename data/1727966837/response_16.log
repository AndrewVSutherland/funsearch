Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]` and the number of remaining integers. This version is shorter and makes a small change to `priority_v0`.

```python
from collections import Counter

@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Returns the priority with which we want to add `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.
  n is the number of possible integers, and k is the integer we want to determine priority for.
  """
  freq = Counter(range(1, n + 1)).get(k, 0)
  remaining = n - k
  return freq / (k * remaining)
```

This version uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]`. It then calculates the priority as the frequency divided by the product of `k` and the number of remaining integers `remaining`. This should improve the priority calculation compared to `priority_v0`.
