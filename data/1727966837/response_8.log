Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]` and the number of multiples of `k` within that range. This version is shorter and makes small changes to the original function.

```python
from collections import Counter

@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Returns the priority with which we want to add `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.
  n is the number of possible integers, and k is the integer we want to determine priority for.
  """
  # Count the occurrences of k and its multiples in the range [1, n]
  counts = Counter(i for i in range(1, n + 1) if i % k == 0)

  # Calculate priority as the sum of frequencies of k and its multiples
  priority = sum(counts.values())

  return priority
```

This version of `priority_v1` should provide a better estimate for the priority of adding `k` to the Salem-Spencer set by considering the frequency of `k` and its multiples in the given range.
