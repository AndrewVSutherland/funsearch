Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]` and the number of remaining integers. This version also uses a generator expression for better performance.

```python
from collections import Counter

@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
    freq = sum(1 for i in range(1, n + 1) if i % k == 0)
    remaining = n - freq
    return freq / (freq + remaining)
```

This version of `priority_v1` calculates the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]` using a generator expression and then divides it by the total number of integers that are either multiples of `k` or not. This gives a higher priority to integers that appear more frequently as multiples and have fewer remaining integers that are not multiples.
