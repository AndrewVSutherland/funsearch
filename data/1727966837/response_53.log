Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[0, n)` and the total number of possible integers `n`. This version uses the formula `priority = (n - k) / n` to give higher priority to smaller integers.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  return (n - k) / n
```

To further improve the function, we can consider the count of integers smaller than `k` and larger than `k` in the range `[0, n)`. This can be done using the formula `priority = (n - 2k) / n` to give higher priority to integers closer to the middle of the range.

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Further improved version of `priority_v1`."""
  return (n - 2 * k) / n
```

To make the code even shorter, we can use a lambda function for `priority_v2`:

```python
priority_v2 = lambda k, n: (n - 2 * k) / n
```

Finally, to make small changes and improve the function on each iteration, you can use the following approach:

```python
def improve_priority(current_priority, k, n):
  return current_priority + (n - 2 * k) / n

priority_v3 = lambda k, n: improve_priority(priority_v2(k, n), k, n)
```

In this way, you can gradually improve the `priority_vX` functions by making small changes on each iteration.
