Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]` and the number of multiples of `k` within that range. This version is shorter and makes small changes to improve the priority calculation.

```python
from collections import Counter

@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Returns the priority with which we want to add `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.
    n is the number of possible integers, and k is the integer we want to determine priority for.
    """
    # Count the frequency of k in the range [1, n]
    freq_k = sum(1 for i in range(1, n + 1) if i % k == 0)

    # Count the frequency of multiples of k in the range [1, n]
    freq_multiples = sum(Counter(i // k for i in range(1, n + 1 if n % k == 0 else n)).values())

    # Calculate the priority as the product of the frequency of k and its multiples, divided by n
    return (freq_k * freq_multiples) / n
```

This version of `priority_v1` considers the frequency of `k` and its multiples, giving higher priority to integers that appear more frequently and have more unique multiples within the range `[1, n]`. The priority is normalized by dividing it by `n` to keep the values within a reasonable range.
