Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]` and the number of unique elements in that range. This version is shorter and makes small changes to `priority_v0`.

```python
from collections import Counter

def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  # Count the frequency of each integer in the range [1, n]
  freq = Counter(range(1, n + 1))
  # Get the frequency of k
  k_freq = freq[k]
  # Calculate the priority as the frequency of k divided by the number of unique elements in the range
  return k_freq / len(freq)
```

This version uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each integer in the range `[1, n]`. It then divides the frequency of `k` by the number of unique elements in that range to calculate the priority.

To further improve this function, you could consider additional factors such as the distance of `k` from the middle of the range or the number of elements greater than `k`. However, these changes would make the function longer and more complex.
