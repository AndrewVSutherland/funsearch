Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[0, n)` and the number of unique elements in that range. This version is more concise and only makes small changes to `priority_v0`.

```python
from collections import Counter

def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  elements = list(range(n))
  freq = Counter(elements)

  # Calculate priority based on frequency of k and number of unique elements
  return freq[k] / (n * len(set(elements)))
```

This version uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each element in the range `[0, n)`. The priority is then calculated as the frequency of `k` divided by the product of `n` and the number of unique elements in the range. This should provide a more meaningful priority value than `priority_v0`.
