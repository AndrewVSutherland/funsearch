Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that uses the concept of information gain to determine the priority. This version calculates the entropy of the current Salem-Spencer set and the entropy of the set after adding the current element. The priority is then the difference between these two entropies.

```python
import math

@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0` using information gain."""
    # Assume `current_set` is the current Salem-Spencer set
    current_set = set(funsearch.state['current_set'])

    # Entropy of the current set
    def entropy(set_size):
        if set_size == 0:
            return 0
        p = set_size / n
        return -p * math.log2(p) - (1 - p) * math.log2(1 - p)

    # Entropy of the set after adding k
    new_set = current_set | {k}
    new_entropy = entropy(len(new_set))

    # Entropy of the current set
    current_entropy = entropy(len(current_set))

    # Priority is the difference in entropy
    priority = new_entropy - current_entropy

    return priority
```

This version makes a small change from `priority_v0` by introducing a basic information gain calculation. To further improve this function, you could consider incorporating more features, such as the degree of the element, the number of neighbors, or other relevant properties.

Additionally, you might want to update the `funsearch.state['current_set']` after each iteration to keep track of the growing Salem-Spencer set.
