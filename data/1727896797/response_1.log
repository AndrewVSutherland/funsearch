To improve the `priority_v1` function over the `priority_v0` function, we can consider the following changes:

1. Calculate the sum of the elements in the tuple `el`.
2. Return the sum as the priority.

Here's the updated code:

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  return sum(el)
```

In this version, the priority is calculated as the sum of the elements in the tuple `el`. A higher sum indicates a higher priority, meaning that elements with a larger sum will be more likely to be added to the cap set.
