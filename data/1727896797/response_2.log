Here's a possible implementation for `priority_v1` that might be an improvement over `priority_v0`. This implementation considers the number of 2's in the tuple and the number of unique values in the tuple. The more 2's and the more unique values, the higher the priority.

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`.
  This version considers the number of 2's in the tuple and the number of unique values in the tuple.
  The more 2's and the more unique values, the higher the priority.
  """
  unique_values = len(set(el))
  num_twos = el.count(2)
  return num_twos + unique_values / n
```

In this implementation, `unique_values` is the number of unique elements in the tuple, and `num_twos` is the number of 2's in the tuple. The priority is calculated as the sum of `num_twos` and the ratio of `unique_values` to `n`. This means that tuples with more 2's and more unique values are given a higher priority.

The reason for dividing `unique_values` by `n` is to normalize this term by the size of the tuple. This ensures that the priority is not too strongly affected by the size of the tuple.
