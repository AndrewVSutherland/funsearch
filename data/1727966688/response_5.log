To improve the `priority_v1` function over the `priority_v0` function, we need to consider the integer `k` and the total number of possible integers `n`. The goal is to return a priority value that determines the order in which we want to add `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.

One way to improve the priority function is to consider the difference between `k` and the largest integer in the current Salem-Spencer set. The larger the difference, the higher the priority we should assign to `k`.

Here's an implementation of the `priority_v1` function that improves upon `priority_v0`:

```python
import numpy as np

def priority_v1(k: int, salem_spencer_set: set) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
    if not salem_spencer_set:
        return float('inf')  # Assign the highest priority to the first element
    else:
        max_in_set = max(salem_spencer_set)
        return k - max_in_set
```

In this implementation, if the Salem-Spencer set is empty, we assign the highest priority to `k` by returning `float('inf')`. Otherwise, we calculate the difference between `k` and the maximum integer in the set and return that as the priority. The larger the difference, the higher the priority.
