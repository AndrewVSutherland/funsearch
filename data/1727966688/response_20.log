Here is an improved version of `priority_v0` that considers the number of divisors of `k` and the size of `n`:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Returns the priority with which we want to add `element` to the salem-spencer set."""
  # Number of divisors of k
  num_divisors = sum(1 for i in range(1, k + 1) if k % i == 0)
  # Priority is inversely proportional to the number of divisors and the size of n
  return 1.0 / (num_divisors * n)
```

This version of the function gives higher priority to numbers with fewer divisors and when the size of `n` is small. This is because numbers with fewer divisors are likely to be more "unique" and contribute more to the Salem-Spencer set, and when `n` is small, it increases the importance of each number in the set.
