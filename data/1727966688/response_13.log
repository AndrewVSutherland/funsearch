Here's an improved version of `priority_v0` that takes into account the number of possible integers `n` and the current integer `k`. The priority is determined based on how close `k` is to the middle of the range `[1, n]`. This means that integers closer to the middle of the range have a higher priority.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
    # Calculate the middle of the range
    mid = n / 2
    # Calculate the distance of k from the middle
    distance = abs(k - mid)
    # The priority is inversely proportional to the distance from the middle
    priority = 1 / (distance + 1)
    return priority
```

In this version, the priority is calculated as the reciprocal of the distance of `k` from the middle of the range, plus one. This way, the priority is always between 0 and 1, and integers closer to the middle have a higher priority. The "+1" is added to avoid division by zero for the middle integer when `n` is odd.
