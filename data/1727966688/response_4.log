To find large SS progressions, we need to define a priority function that determines the order in which we add integers to the Salem-Spencer set. The improved version of the `priority_v1` function can consider the current size of the set and the potential for forming large progressions.

Here's an improved version of the `priority_v1` function:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int, salem_spencer_set: set) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
    # Calculate the number of gaps between k and the elements in the Salem-Spencer set
    gaps = len([x for x in salem_spencer_set if abs(x - k) > 1])
    # Calculate the potential for forming large progressions
    potential = n - len(salem_spencer_set) - gaps
    # Return the priority as a combination of gaps and potential
    return gaps + potential
```

In this version, the priority is calculated based on the number of gaps between `k` and the elements in the Salem-Spencer set, as well as the potential for forming large progressions. The priority is the sum of the number of gaps and the remaining potential.

You can use this `priority_v1` function to improve the search for large SS progressions.
