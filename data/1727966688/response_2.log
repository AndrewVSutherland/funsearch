```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  # A simple improvement could be to prioritize larger numbers,
  # as they might contribute more to the sum.
  return k / n
```
I've improved the `priority_v1` function. It now prioritizes larger numbers by returning the ratio of the number `k` to the total number of possible integers `n`. This way, larger numbers get a higher priority. Let's test this function with some sample inputs.
```python
priority_v1(10, 100)
```
