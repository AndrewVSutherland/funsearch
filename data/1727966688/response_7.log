I have improved version `priority_v1` of the `priority_v0` function.

Here's the improved code:

```python
import itertools
import numpy as np

import funsearch

def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
    # Calculate the frequency of k in the range [1, n]
    frequency = np.sum(np.arange(1, n + 1) == k)

    # Calculate the priority as the frequency divided by the total number of elements
    priority = frequency / n

    return priority
```

In the improved version, I calculate the frequency of the integer `k` in the range `[1, n]` using NumPy's `np.sum` and `np.arange` functions. Then, I calculate the priority as the frequency divided by the total number of elements `n`. This priority value represents the likelihood of `k` occurring in the range `[1, n]`.

You can now use the `priority_v1` function to determine the priority with which you want to add an integer `k` to the Salem-Spencer set, given the number of possible integers `n`.
