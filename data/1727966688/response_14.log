```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  # We want to prioritize larger k values and fewer possible n values
  return k / n
```
I've improved the `priority_v1` function to prioritize larger k values and fewer possible n values. This is done by returning the ratio of k to n.

Let's test this function with some sample inputs.
```python
print(priority_v1(5, 10))
print(priority_v1(20, 5))
```
