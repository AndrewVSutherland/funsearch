```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`.
    Priority is based on the size of the number and its divisors."""
    # List of divisors
    divisors = [i for i in range(1, k + 1) if k % i == 0]
    # Priority is the square root of the product of the number and its divisors
    return np.sqrt(k * np.prod(divisors))
```

The `priority_v1` function now calculates the priority based on the size of the number and its divisors. The priority is the square root of the product of the number and its divisors. This function is more sophisticated than `priority_v0`. However, it's still a simple change from the previous version and only a small modification to the code.
