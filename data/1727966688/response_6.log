I have improved the `priority_v1` function to calculate the priority with which we want to add `k` to the Salem-Spencer set. The priority is determined based on the ratio of `k` to the total number of possible integers `n`.

Here's the updated code:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`.

  Returns the priority with which we want to add `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.
  `n` is the number of possible integers, and `k` is the integer we want to determine priority for.
  """
  return k / n
```

Now, the priority is calculated as the ratio of `k` to `n`. This means that larger integers will have a higher priority, as they contribute more to the ratio.

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`.

  Returns the priority with which we want to add `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.
  `n` is the number of possible integers, and `k` is the integer we want to determine priority for.
  """
  return k / n

# Testing the function with some sample values
print(priority_v1(5, 10))  # Expected output: 0.5
print(priority_v1(8, 20))  # Expected output: 0.4
```
