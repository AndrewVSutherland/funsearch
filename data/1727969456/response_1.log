The `priority_v1` function could be improved by taking into account the properties of large SS progressions. A large SS progression is a sequence of integers where the difference between any two consecutive numbers is a prime number. The priority of a number could be improved by considering the number of prime gaps that can be formed by including that number in the sequence.

Here is a simple improvement to the `priority_v1` function:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, ss_set: set) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`.

  Args:
    k: The integer we want to determine priority for.
    ss_set: The current Salem-Spencer set.

  Returns:
    The priority of adding the integer `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.
  """
  # Calculate the difference between `k` and each number in `ss_set`
  diffs = [abs(k - s) for s in ss_set]
  # Count the number of prime differences
  prime_diffs = sum(is_prime(d) for d in diffs)
  # Return the priority as the proportion of prime differences to all differences
  return prime_diffs / len(diffs) if diffs else 0.0

def is_prime(n: int) -> bool:
  """Checks if a number is prime."""
  if n < 2:
    return False
  for i in range(2, int(np.sqrt(n)) + 1):
    if n % i == 0:
      return False
  return True
```

In this version, the priority of a number is defined as the proportion of prime differences between that number and the numbers already in the Salem-Spencer set. This prioritizes numbers that form more prime gaps with the existing set.
