Here is an improved version of `priority_v0`, `priority_v1`, that assigns a higher priority to smaller integers and to integers that are part of a large progression in the Salem-Spencer set:

```python
import numpy as np

def priority_v1(k: int, n: int, salem_spencer_set: set) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  # The larger the number, the lower the priority
  priority = 1 / (k + 1)

  # If the integer is already in the Salem-Spencer set, it gets a tiny priority
  if k in salem_spencer_set:
    return priority * 0.00001

  # Check if adding k to the Salem-Spencer set forms a large progression
  # A progression is considered large if it contains more than 20% of the possible integers
  # A progression is a set of consecutive integers
  for i in range(k, n + 1):
    progression = set(range(k, i + 1))
    if len(progression & salem_spencer_set) / len(progression) > 0.2:
      # The more integers in the progression that are already in the Salem-Spencer set,
      # the higher the priority
      priority *= len(progression & salem_spencer_set) / len(progression)
      break

  return priority
```

This version of the function assigns a higher priority to smaller integers (since they have a higher chance of being part of a large progression) and to integers that are part of a large progression in the Salem-Spencer set. The priority is calculated as the product of the inverse of the integer and the ratio of the number of integers in the progression that are already in the Salem-Spencer set to the total number of integers in the progression. If the integer is already in the Salem-Spencer set, it gets a tiny priority to avoid adding it again.
