It seems like there's a mistake in the code snippet. The `priority_v1` function is defined but not implemented. Here's an improved version of `priority_v0` as `priority_v1`:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  # Instead of just dividing k by n, we can subtract k from n and then divide by n
  # This puts more emphasis on larger numbers and less on smaller numbers
  return (n - k) / n
```

This version of the function gives more priority to larger numbers, as it subtracts `k` from `n` before dividing by `n`. This means that larger `k` will result in a smaller priority value, while smaller `k` will result in a larger priority value.
