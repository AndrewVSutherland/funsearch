The code provided defines a function `priority_v0` which returns a priority value for a given integer `k` out of a total number of possible integers `n`. The priority is calculated as the ratio of `k` to `n`.

The task is to improve upon this function in a subsequent version, `priority_v1`. However, the provided code for `priority_v1` is incomplete. To improve it, we can consider additional factors for prioritization, such as the frequency of occurrence of the integer `k` in a dataset, if available. Without additional information, it's difficult to suggest a specific improvement.

Here's a possible implementation of `priority_v1` that takes into account the frequency of occurrence of `k` in a dataset:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int, dataset: np.ndarray) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0` that takes into account the frequency of occurrence of `k` in a dataset."""
  frequency = np.count_nonzero(dataset == k) / len(dataset)
  return priority_v0(k, n) * frequency
```

In this version, `priority_v1` computes the frequency of `k` in the given `dataset` and multiplies it with the priority value from `priority_v0`. This way, integers that occur more frequently in the dataset will have a higher priority.
