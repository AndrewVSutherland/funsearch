The function `priority_v1` was not provided. However, based on the context and the name of the function, it's likely that the function will compute a priority value for a given integer `k` out of a total number of possible integers `n`.

The improved version of `priority_v0` might consider the frequency of the integer `k` in the total set of integers. This could be done by dividing the count of `k` in the total set by the total number of integers `n`.

Here's a possible implementation:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int, data: list[int]) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  return data.count(k) / n
```

In this function, `data` is the total set of integers. The function counts the occurrences of `k` in `data` and divides it by `n` to compute the priority.

Note: This function assumes that `data` is a list of integers and can be quite slow for large lists because it has to scan the entire list every time `count` is called. If performance is a concern, a more efficient data structure or algorithm might be needed.

Also, this function doesn't handle the case where `n` is 0 to avoid division by zero errors. In a real-world application, you might want to add error checking for this and other potential issues.
