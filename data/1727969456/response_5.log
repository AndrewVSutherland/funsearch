Here is a simple version of `priority_v1` that gives an increased priority to larger gaps between the elements in the Salem-Spencer set. This is based on the assumption that larger gaps may lead to larger SS progressions.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int, ss_set: list) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`.
  ss_set is the current salem-spencer set.
  """
  if not ss_set:  # If the set is empty, we prioritize adding the largest number
    return float(k)
  else:
    # Calculate the mean gap between elements in the set
    gaps = [ss_set[i] - ss_set[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(ss_set))]
    mean_gap = np.mean(gaps)

    # Give priority to the number that creates the largest new gap
    return float(k - ss_set[-1] - mean_gap)
```
The function takes into account the current Salem-Spencer set `ss_set` and calculates the mean gap between elements in the set. It then returns the priority as the difference between the candidate number and the end of the Salem-Spencer set, minus the mean gap. This way, it prioritizes adding numbers that create larger gaps with the existing elements in the set.
