Sure, I'd be happy to help improve your code. In this case, the function `priority_v1` is an improved version of `priority_v0`, but you haven't specified how it should be improved.

Assuming that the priority should be inversely proportional to the value of `k`, we can modify `priority_v1` as follows:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`. Priority is inversely proportional to `k`."""
  if k == 0:
    return float('-inf')  # To avoid division by zero
  return 1.0 / k
```

This way, larger `k` values will have lower priority. If there's a different logic you had in mind, please let me know!
