Here is a basic implementation of `priority_v1`:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`.
  This version gives higher priority to smaller numbers and numbers closer to `n`.
  """
  return (n - k) / n + 1 / (k + 1)
```

This version of the function calculates the priority by taking two factors into account:

1. The distance of `k` from `n`: The term `(n - k) / n` calculates the fraction of `n` that `k` is away from `n`, with a smaller value indicating a closer distance. This factor gives higher priority to smaller numbers and numbers closer to `n`.

2. The size of `k`: The term `1 / (k + 1)` gives smaller values for larger `k`. This factor ensures that even if `k` is close to `n`, it won't get a higher priority than smaller numbers.

The final priority is the sum of these two factors. By adding these factors, we ensure that both the size and the distance of `k` from `n` are considered when determining the priority.
