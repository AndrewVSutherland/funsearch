Here's a simple improvement to `priority_v1`:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Returns the priority with which we want to add `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.

  The priority is calculated as the proportion of the total possible integers (n) that `k` represents.
  """
  return k / n
```

This way, larger integers get a higher priority since they represent a larger proportion of the total possible integers.
