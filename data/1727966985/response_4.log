Here's an improved version of `priority_v1`. This version calculates the priority by considering the number of prime factors of `k` and the total number of possible integers `n`. The more prime factors `k` has, the higher its priority.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  def prime_factors(n):
    i = 2
    factors = []
    while i * i <= n:
      if n % i:
        i += 1
      else:
        n //= i
        factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
      factors.append(n)
    return factors

  factors = prime_factors(k)
  return len(factors) / n
```

This version of `priority_v1` calculates the prime factors of `k` and divides the number of prime factors by the total number of possible integers `n`. This gives us a value between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates that `k` has the maximum number of prime factors for its size.
