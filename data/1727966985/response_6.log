To improve the priority function `priority_v0`, we need to consider the problem statement and the given parameters `k` and `n`. The priority function should return a score that determines the order in which integers `k` should be added to the Salem-Spencer set, given a total number of possible integers `n`.

Based on the problem statement and the goal of finding large SS progressions, a simple improvement could be to prioritize integers `k` that are closer to the middle of the range `[1, n]`. This is because integers closer to the middle are more likely to form a large progression with other integers.

Here's an improved version of the priority function `priority_v1`:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  middle = n / 2
  distance_to_middle = abs(k - middle)
  priority = middle - distance_to_middle
  return priority
```

In this version, we calculate the distance of `k` from the middle of the range (`n / 2`) and subtract it from the middle value. The resulting priority score will be higher for integers closer to the middle of the range.
