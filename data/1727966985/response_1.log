To improve the `priority_v1` function over the `priority_v0` function, we need to consider the integer `k` and the total number of possible integers `n`. The goal is to return a priority value that indicates how desirable it is to add `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.

A simple improvement over `priority_v0` could be to assign a priority based on the ratio of `k` to `n`. This way, larger integers will have a higher priority. Here's an updated version of the `priority_v1` function:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Returns the priority with which we want to add `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.
    n is the number of possible integers, and k is the integer we want to determine priority for.
    """
    return k / n
```

This priority value will range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the highest priority for the largest integer.
