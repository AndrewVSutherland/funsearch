Sure, I'd be happy to help you improve your code. However, I see that you've only provided the `priority_v0` function and the description for the `priority_v1` function. Since I don't have any information about the data or the problem context, I'll assume a simple scenario where the priority is calculated based on the sum of elements in the tuple.

Here's a possible improvement for the `priority_v1` function:

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`. Calculates priority based on the sum of elements in the tuple."""
  return sum(el)
```

This function will return the sum of the elements in the tuple, which can be used as a priority value. The larger the sum, the higher the priority.
