Here's a possible implementation for `priority_v1` that favors elements with more 2's and fewer 1's:

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`. Favors elements with more 2's and fewer 1's."""
  return el.count(2) - el.count(1)
```

This version of the function calculates the difference between the number of 2's and the number of 1's in the element, and uses this value as the priority. An element with more 2's and fewer 1's will have a higher priority and be more likely to be added to the cap set.

This implementation is simple and easy to understand, and it makes a small but significant improvement over the previous version. However, it may not be optimal, and there may be other ways to balance the number of 2's and 1's in the cap set that result in a higher total sum. Further improvements to the priority function may involve more complex calculations or additional considerations, such as the number of 0's in the element or the position of the 2's and 1's.
