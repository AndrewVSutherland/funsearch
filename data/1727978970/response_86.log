It seems that you want to improve a function named `priority_v1` which takes a tuple of integers and an integer as input and returns a float as output. The function is intended to be used as a priority function for adding an element to a cap set.

Currently, the code only contains the definition of `priority_v0` and `priority_v1`, but the implementation of `priority_v1` is missing.

Without more specific information about the problem and the desired improvements, it's hard to provide a meaningful implementation. However, I can give a basic example of how `priority_v1` might look like based on a common pattern in such priority functions: weighted sum of elements in the tuple.

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  # Define weights for each position in the tuple
  weights = np.linspace(1.0, 0.1, n)

  # Calculate weighted sum of elements in the tuple
  priority = np.dot(el, weights)

  return priority
```

In this example, the weights are linearly decreasing from 1.0 to 0.1, which means that the first element in the tuple has the most significant impact on the priority, and the last element has the least significant impact. The priority is calculated as a weighted sum of elements in the tuple.
