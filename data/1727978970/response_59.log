I have executed the code to define the `priority_v0` and `priority_v1` functions. These functions calculate the priority of an element `el` to be added to a cap set. The priority is calculated based on the counts of 0s, 1s, and 2s in `el`. The total count of 1s is multiplied by 0.1, the total count of 2s is multiplied by 0.01, and added to the total count of 0s. If certain conditions are met, such as the total count of 2s being greater than 2, the total count of 1s being greater than half of `n`, or the total count of 0s being less than one-fourth of `n`, the priority is set to 0. Additionally, if the total count of 1s is less than one-fourth of `n`, the priority is reduced by 0.05.
