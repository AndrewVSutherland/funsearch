Here's a simple improvement over `priority_v0`. This version prioritizes elements with more 2's and less 0's, as these elements are more likely to be part of a large cap set.

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  return el.count(2) - el.count(0)
```

This function works by counting the number of 2's and 0's in the element. It returns the difference between the count of 2's and the count of 0's, which serves as a simple heuristic for how likely the element is to be part of a large cap set.

Note that this is a very basic improvement and may not be sufficient for finding the optimal cap sets. For a more sophisticated approach, you might want to consider using a more complex heuristic or a search algorithm that can handle the constraints of a cap set problem more effectively.
