Here's a simple improvement for the priority function. The priority could be defined as the sum of the elements in the tuple `el`, as this would give more importance to elements with higher values. This way, we are more likely to include elements with higher values in our cap set.

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`.
  The priority is defined as the sum of the elements in the tuple.
  """
  return sum(el)
```

This function calculates the sum of all elements in the tuple `el`, which is then returned as the priority. A higher sum indicates a higher priority.
