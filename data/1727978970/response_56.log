The function `priority_v1` is a modification of `priority_v0`. To improve `priority_v0`, we can adjust the priority calculation to give more weight to elements with more unique numbers and fewer occurrences of the number 2. This might help to find larger cap sets more efficiently.

A possible implementation of `priority_v1` could be:

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  return len(set(el)) - 0.2 * el.count(2)
```

In this version, `len(set(el))` is added to the priority which increases the priority for elements with more unique numbers. The weight for the number 2 is increased to 0.2 to further decrease the priority for elements with more occurrences of 2.
