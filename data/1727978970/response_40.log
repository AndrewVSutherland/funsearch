```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  # Calculate the number of 2s and 1s in the tuple
  count_2 = el.count(2)
  count_1 = el.count(1)

  # Prioritize tuples with more 2s and then more 1s
  return count_2 * 10 + count_1
```
The priority_v1 function takes a tuple `el` and an integer `n` as input. It calculates the number of 2s and 1s in the tuple. The function then prioritizes tuples with more 2s and then more 1s by returning a value that is 10 times the number of 2s plus the number of 1s. This improvement over the `priority_v0` function allows us to more effectively search for large cap sets by prioritizing tuples that contain more 2s and then more 1s.
