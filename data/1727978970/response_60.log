It seems there's a mistake in your code. The provided function `priority_v2` is not defined, which causes the error.

However, I can see the definition of `priority_v1` which is an improved version of `priority_v0`. Based on the docstring, it looks like you're trying to calculate a priority value for an element in a cap set. The priority is based on the sum of the elements, the number of unique elements, and the standard deviation of the elements.

Here's the definition of `priority_v1`:

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  return sum(el) / len(set(el)) / np.std(el)
```

If you want to define `priority_v2`, you should follow a similar structure. The docstring should explain how `priority_v2` improves upon `priority_v1`. Then, you can define the function with the appropriate calculation.
