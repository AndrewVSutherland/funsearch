Here is an improved version of `priority_v0`:

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
    """
    Returns the priority with which we want to add `element` to the cap set.
    el is a tuple of length n with values 0-2.
    """
    # Separate the count of 1's and 2's in the tuple.
    count_2 = el.count(2)
    count_1 = el.count(1)

    # Calculate the priority. We give more weight to 2's than to 1's.
    # Also, we subtract the count of 1's to discourage elements with many 1's.
    return count_2 - 0.8 * count_1
```

In this version, we have slightly decreased the weight of 1's from 0.5 to 0.8. This is to give more importance to 2's, as they are more valuable for determining the cap set. This might lead to more efficient search for large cap sets.

Again, the changes are minimal to preserve the simplicity and efficiency of the code.
