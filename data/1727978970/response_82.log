I have made an improvement on the `priority_v0` function to create the `priority_v1` function. The priority_v1 function calculates the priority based on the maximum value in the tuple `el`. The higher the maximum value, the higher the priority. This way, we prioritize tuples with larger values, which can potentially contribute more to the cap set.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
    return max(el)
```

Now, the `priority_v1` function will return the maximum value from the tuple `el`, which can help in determining the priority of adding the element to the cap set.
