Here is a possible improved version of `priority_v0`:

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`.

  The priority is calculated as the sum of elements in the tuple.
  The higher the sum, the higher the priority.
  """
  return sum(el)
```

This version of the function assigns a higher priority to elements with more 1s and 2s. This could potentially improve the performance of the function, as it may lead to the creation of larger cap sets. However, it's important to note that this is a simple heuristic, and there may be other ways to improve the function that take into account more complex relationships between the elements in the tuple.

In addition, it's worth mentioning that the function could be further improved by normalizing the priority, so that it always falls within a certain range. This could ensure that the priority is always meaningful, and that it doesn't produce extreme values that could lead to numerical instability. However, this was not done in the suggested improvement, to keep the changes small and the code short.
