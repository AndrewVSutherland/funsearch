The task is to improve the `priority_v1` function over the `priority_v0` function, which currently returns a constant priority of 0.0. The `priority_v1` function should take a tuple of integers `el` and an integer `n` as input, where `el` is a tuple of length `n` with values ranging from 0 to 2. The function should return a priority score that indicates how desirable it is to add `el` to a cap set.

To improve the `priority_v1` function, we can start by considering the following:

1. The length of the tuple `el`: A longer tuple may have more potential to contribute to the cap set, so we can give it a higher priority.
2. The sum of the values in the tuple `el`: A tuple with a higher sum may be more desirable, so we can give it a higher priority.
3. The distribution of values in the tuple `el`: A tuple with more evenly distributed values may be more balanced and contribute more to the cap set, so we can give it a higher priority.

Here's a possible implementation of `priority_v1` that considers these factors:

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
    length_factor = len(el) / n
    sum_factor = sum(el) / (2 * n)
    distribution_factor = np.std(el) / np.sqrt(n)
    return length_factor + sum_factor - distribution_factor
```

In this implementation, `length_factor` is the ratio of the length of `el` to `n`. `sum_factor` is the ratio of the sum of the values in `el` to the maximum possible sum of `n` values, where each value is 2. `distribution_factor` is the ratio of the standard deviation of the values in `el` to the maximum possible standard deviation of `n` values, where each value is 2. The priority score is calculated as the sum of these factors, with the `distribution_factor` subtracted to penalize tuples with less balanced distributions.

This implementation assumes that the cap set should be as large as possible, contain tuples with high sums and evenly distributed values, and be as balanced as possible. Adjustments may be necessary depending on the specific requirements of the cap set.
