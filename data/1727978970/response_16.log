Sure, I can help with that. The `priority_v1` function could be improved by giving higher priority to tuples that have more 2s and fewer 1s. This is because a 2 contributes more to the total sum than a 1, and a 0 contributes nothing. Here's a simple implementation:

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`.
  Gives higher priority to tuples that have more 2s and fewer 1s.
  """
  return el.count(2) - el.count(1)
```

This function counts the number of 2s and 1s in the tuple and returns the difference. The higher the difference, the higher the priority.
