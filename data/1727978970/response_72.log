Here is an improved version of `priority_v0`. The priority is calculated based on the count of 2's in the tuple and the sum of all elements in the tuple. This combination is used to give more preference to tuples that have more 2's and less total sum.

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  count_of_2s = el.count(2)
  total_sum = sum(el)
  return count_of_2s - total_sum / n
```

This version of the function is slightly more complex than `priority_v0`, but it should yield better results for the problem of finding large cap sets, as it takes into account both the number of 2's (which contribute more to the cap set) and the total sum (which should ideally be minimized).
