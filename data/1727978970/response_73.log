Here is a possible solution:

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  # Prioritize elements with more 1's (since a 1 contributes to the sum)
  return el.count(1)
```

This version of the function `priority_v1` will prioritize elements with more 1's because a 1 contributes to the sum of the cap set. This is a small improvement over `priority_v0` which always returned 0.

This solution is efficient because it uses Python's built-in `tuple.count` method to count the number of 1's in the tuple, which has a time complexity of O(n). The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the count of 1's.

The code is also short and easy to understand, which is in line with the problem's requirements.
