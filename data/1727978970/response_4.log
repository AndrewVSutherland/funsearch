```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
    # Count the number of ones (cap sets) and twos (anti-cap sets) in the tuple
    num_ones = el.count(1)
    num_twos = el.count(2)

    # Prioritize tuples with more ones than twos
    return float(num_ones - num_twos)
```
I defined the `priority_v1` function, which takes a tuple `el` of length `n` with values 0-2 and returns a priority value for adding that element to the cap set. This function counts the number of ones (cap sets) and twos (anti-cap sets) in the tuple and returns the difference between the number of ones and twos as the priority value. This way, tuples with more ones than twos are prioritized, as they contribute more to the cap set.
