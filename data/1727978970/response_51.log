Here's an improved version of `priority_v0`:

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`.

  This version prioritizes tuples with more 1's and fewer 2's.
  """
  return el.count(1) - el.count(2)
```

This function counts the number of 1's and 2's in the tuple and subtracts the count of 2's from the count of 1's. The result is the priority of the tuple. Tuples with more 1's and fewer 2's will have a higher priority.
