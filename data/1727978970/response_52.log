The given code defines a series of functions `priority_v0`, `priority_v1`, and `priority_v2` that calculate a priority value for a given tuple `el` and an integer `n`. The priority value is used to determine the order in which elements are added to a cap set.

The `priority_v0` and `priority_v1` functions are identical, as there is no change mentioned in the docstring of `priority_v1`.

The `priority_v0` and `priority_v1` functions calculate the priority based on the count of 0, 1, and 2 in the tuple `el`. The priority is calculated as the sum of the total count of 0s, the total count of 1s multiplied by 0.1, and the total count of 2s multiplied by 0.01. However, if any of the following conditions are met, the priority is set to 0:
- The total count of 2s is greater than 2
- The total count of 1s is greater than half of `n`
- The total count of 0s is less than a quarter of `n`

Additionally, if the total count of 1s is less than a quarter of `n`, the priority is reduced by 0.05.

The `priority_v2` function is defined but not implemented. It is mentioned that it is an improved version of `priority_v1`, but no specific changes are mentioned.

To improve the code, it would be helpful to know the specific requirements and constraints of the problem. Based on that, we can make more informed decisions about the changes needed in the `priority_v2` function.
