The function `priority_v1` can be improved by taking into account the distribution of 0s and 2s in the tuple `el`. Here's a suggestion for how this could be done:

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  # Penalize larger sets more for 1s, reward more for 2s, and penalize for 0s
  return sum(el) / n**2 + sum(x == 2 for x in el)**2 - sum(x == 0 for x in el)**1.5 - sum(x == 1 for x in el) / n**2
```

In this version, I've increased the penalty for 0s by raising to the power of 1.5 instead of 2. This will make the function more sensitive to sets with a larger number of 0s.
