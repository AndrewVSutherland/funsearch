Sure, I can help you improve your code. Here's a simple improvement to your `priority_v1` function:

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
  """Returns the priority with which we want to add `element` to the cap set.
  el is a tuple of length n with values 0-2.
  """
  # The priority is calculated as the sum of elements in the tuple.
  # The higher the sum, the higher the priority.
  return sum(el)
```

This function calculates the priority based on the sum of elements in the tuple. The higher the sum, the higher the priority. This is a simple improvement over the `priority_v0` function, which always returned 0.0.
