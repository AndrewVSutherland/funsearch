I've updated the `priority_v1` function to match the description of the `priority_v0` function. This function calculates the priority of adding an element to a cap set based on the sum of its elements, the number of unique elements, and the standard deviation of the elements. It prioritizes elements that have a higher sum, a lower number of unique elements, and a lower standard deviation.

The next step would be to introduce small changes to `priority_v2`. However, the description for `priority_v2` is missing, so I'm unable to make any specific improvements based on that description. Could you please provide more details about the changes you're considering for `priority_v2`?
