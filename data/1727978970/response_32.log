Here's a simple implementation of `priority_v1` that considers the total number of 1s in the tuple and the number of 2s. It gives a higher priority to tuples with more 1s and fewer 2s, as these are more likely to contribute to a larger cap set.

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  num_ones = el.count(1)
  num_twos = el.count(2)
  return num_ones - num_twos
```

This function works by subtracting the number of 2s from the number of 1s in the tuple. A higher result indicates a higher priority, as tuples with more 1s and fewer 2s are more likely to contribute to a larger cap set.
