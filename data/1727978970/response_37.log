It seems like there is a missing part of the code in the `priority_v1` function. However, I can provide an improved version of `priority_v0` function based on the description.

In the context of finding large cap sets, a cap set is a subset of a set system where no subgroup of the cap set has a sum greater than a certain value. The priority function is used to decide which elements to add to the cap set first.

A simple improvement could be to calculate the sum of the elements in the tuple and return the negative value of the sum. This way, the elements with the lowest sum will have the highest priority.

Here's the improved version of `priority_v0`:

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
  """Returns the priority with which we want to add `element` to the cap set.
  el is a tuple of length n with values 0-2.
  """
  return -sum(el)
```

This function will return a higher priority (i.e., a more negative value) for tuples with smaller sums.
