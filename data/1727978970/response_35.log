Here is an improved version of `priority_v0` that takes into account the number of ones and twos in the tuple:

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  return el.count(1) + el.count(2) * 2
```

This version of the function gives a higher priority to tuples with more ones and twos, as the `count` function is used to count the number of ones and twos in the tuple. The twos are given a higher priority by multiplying their count by 2.
