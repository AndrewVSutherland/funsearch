Here's an improved version of `priority_v0` which prioritizes tuples with more 2's and fewer 0's. This is because a 2 is more likely to contribute to the set size, while a 0 is less likely to contribute.

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  two_count = el.count(2)
  zero_count = el.count(0)
  return two_count - 0.5 * zero_count
```

This function counts the number of 2's and 0's in the tuple `el`, and returns a priority value that is the number of 2's minus half the number of 0's. This means that each 2 adds 1 to the priority, while each 0 subtracts 0.5 from the priority. This should help to prioritize tuples that are more likely to contribute to the size of the cap set.
