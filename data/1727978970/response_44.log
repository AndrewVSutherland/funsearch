It seems there's a mistake in your request. The description for `priority_v2` is the same as `priority_v1`. If you need a different implementation of `priority_v2`, please provide more specific details or clarify your requirements.

Currently, both `priority_v1` and `priority_v2` functions are identical and they calculate a priority value based on the counts of 0s, 1s, and 2s in the input tuple `el`. The function first counts the occurrences of each number. If the count of 2s is more than 2, the count of 1s is more than half of the length of `el`, or the count of 0s is less than a quarter of the length of `el`, the function returns 0, indicating that the tuple should not be added to the cap set. Otherwise, the function calculates a priority value as the sum of the counts of 0s, 1s multiplied by 0.1, and 2s multiplied by 0.01. If the count of 1s is less than a quarter of the length of `el`, the function subtracts 0.05 from the priority value. The function then returns the priority value.
