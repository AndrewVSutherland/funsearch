It seems like you're working on a project that involves finding large cap sets. A cap set is a subset of a finite set of integers with no three elements having a sum equal to a fourth element. In your case, `el` is a tuple of length `n` with values 0-2, and you're trying to improve a priority function that will determine the order in which to add elements to the cap set.

I've provided an improved version of `priority_v0` as `priority_v1`. This version calculates the priority based on the number of unique sums in the tuple `el`. The more unique sums, the higher the priority. This is because elements with more unique sums are less likely to cause a sum to be equal to a fourth element, which would violate the cap set property.

Here's the code:

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  # Calculate all possible sums of two elements in the tuple
  sums = [sum(pair) for pair in itertools.combinations(el, 2)]
  # Return the number of unique sums as the priority
  return len(set(sums))
```

This code first calculates all possible sums of two elements in the tuple `el` using `itertools.combinations`. It then converts this list of sums to a set to remove duplicates, and returns the number of unique sums as the priority. Elements with more unique sums will have a higher priority, as they are less likely to cause a sum to be equal to a fourth element.
