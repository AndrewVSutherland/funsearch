Sure, I'd be happy to help you improve your `priority_v2` function. However, since the code for `priority_v2` is not provided, I can't directly modify it.

But based on the comments in your code, it seems like you're trying to improve a function that calculates a priority score for adding an element to a cap set. The function `priority_v1` is an improved version of `priority_v0`, and you're looking to create an improved version of `priority_v1`.

Here's a general suggestion on how you might improve `priority_v1`:

1. **Consider the position of the elements in the tuple**: The position of an element in the tuple could potentially provide additional information about its importance. For example, you might decide that elements in the first half of the tuple are more important than those in the second half.

2. **Penalize elements that are the same as preceding elements**: If an element is the same as a preceding element, it might be less valuable to add it to the cap set. You could penalize such elements in your priority score.

3. **Reward elements that complete a pattern**: If there's a pattern that's desirable in your cap sets, you could reward elements that complete that pattern. For example, if you're looking for cap sets with an increasing sequence, you could reward elements that extend the sequence.

4. **Use more sophisticated techniques**: If the above suggestions don't improve your results, you might want to consider more sophisticated techniques. For example, you could use machine learning to predict the value of a new element based on the existing elements in the cap set.
