To improve the `priority_v1` function over `priority_v0`, we can consider several factors. One factor could be the sum of elements in the tuple `el`. A larger sum might indicate a more valuable cap set.

Here's a simple modification to `priority_v0` that takes into account the sum of elements in `el`:

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  return sum(el)
```

This function will return the sum of the elements in `el` as the priority. A cap set with a larger sum might be more valuable, depending on the specific problem.

However, this is a very basic improvement and may not be sufficient for all problems. A more sophisticated approach might involve considering the distribution of elements in `el`, or the relationship between the elements. This could involve more complex calculations or the use of additional data.
