Here's a possible improvement over `priority_v0`. This version uses the sum of elements in `el` as the priority, since larger sums represent larger cap sets.

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
  """Returns the priority with which we want to add `element` to the cap set.
  el is a tuple of length n with values 0-2.
  """
  return sum(el)
```

This function returns a higher priority for elements with more 2s and 1s, which are more likely to be included in a large cap set.

However, this function still doesn't consider the constraints of a cap set â€“ that is, the requirement that the sum of each subset of the cap set should be less than or equal to n. A more sophisticated priority function would take this into account.
