It seems like you're working on a function called `priority_v1`, which is an improved version of a previous function called `priority_v0`. However, it appears that the code for `priority_v1` is missing.

Based on the description you provided, it seems that the function `priority_v1` should calculate a priority value for a given element `el` and a number `n`. The element `el` is a tuple of length `n` with values 0-2. The priority value is used to determine the order in which elements are added to a cap set.

Here's a simple way to improve the `priority_v0` function by counting the number of 2's in the element `el` and using that count as the priority value:

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
    return el.count(2)
```

This function will return the number of 2's in the tuple `el`, which could be a simple way to prioritize elements for adding to a cap set. However, without more context or specific requirements, it's difficult to suggest a more appropriate priority calculation.
