To improve the `priority_v0` function, we can consider the following:

1. The count of each value (0, 1, 2) in the tuple.
2. The sum of all values in the tuple.
3. The variance or standard deviation of the values in the tuple.

By using these properties, we can prioritize tuples that contain more 2s and fewer 0s, and have a smaller variance (which means the values are more spread out). The sum could be used to normalize the priority, so that tuples with the same count of 2s and 0s but different sums are not given the same priority.

Here's an implementation of `priority_v1` based on these considerations:

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  count_2 = el.count(2)
  count_0 = el.count(0)
  sum_el = sum(el)
  variance = np.var(el)

  # Prioritize tuples with more 2s and fewer 0s, and smaller variance
  priority = count_2 - count_0 - variance

  # Normalize priority by sum of elements
  normalized_priority = priority / sum_el if sum_el != 0 else 0

  return normalized_priority
```

This implementation should perform better than `priority_v0` in most scenarios, as it takes into account more properties of the input tuple.
