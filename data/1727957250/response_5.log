Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the number of elements in the cap set and the number of elements that can be added to it. This version also uses the sum of squares of the elements to give more priority to sets with smaller numbers.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  return (k / n) * np.sum(np.square(range(k)))
```

This version calculates the sum of squares of the first `k` natural numbers and multiplies it by the ratio of `k` to `n`. This gives more priority to sets with smaller numbers and also considers the size of the cap set.

You can further improve this function by considering other factors, such as the distribution of the elements or the number of unique elements in the set. However, keep in mind that the goal is to make small changes on each iteration and keep the code short.
