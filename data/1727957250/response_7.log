Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the sum of elements in the tuple and the number of elements equal to 2. This version is a small change from `priority_v0` and aims to be concise.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Returns the priority with which we want to add `element` to the cap set.
  el is a tuple of length n with values 0-2.
  """
  return sum(el for el in range(n) if el == 2) + np.log(k + 1)
```

This version gives higher priority to tuples with more elements equal to 2 and also considers the current iteration `k`. The `np.log(k + 1)` term ensures that the priority increases as `k` increases, giving more weight to later iterations.
