Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the sum of elements in the tuple. This version is a small change from `priority_v0` and aims to prioritize tuples with larger sums.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int, el: tuple) -> float:
  """Returns the priority with which we want to add `el` to the cap set.
  el is a tuple of length n with values 0-2.
  """
  return sum(el)
```

To keep the code short and maintain small changes, I've added an `el` parameter to the function, which represents the tuple of length `n` with values 0-2. The function now returns the sum of the elements in the tuple, prioritizing tuples with larger sums.

You can further improve this function by considering other factors, such as the number of unique elements or the distribution of elements in the tuple. Here's an example of `priority_v2` that considers the number of unique elements:

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int, el: tuple) -> float:
  """Returns the priority with which we want to add `el` to the cap set.
  el is a tuple of length n with values 0-2.
  """
  return sum(el) + len(set(el))
```

In this version, the function returns the sum of the elements plus the number of unique elements in the tuple. This version prioritizes tuples with larger sums and more unique elements.
