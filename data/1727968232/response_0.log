Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]` and the number of elements in the Salem-Spencer set. This version is shorter and only makes small changes to `priority_v0`.

```python
from collections import Counter

@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int, ss_set: set = None) -> float:
    """Returns the priority with which we want to add `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.
    n is the number of possible integers, and k is the integer we want to determine priority for.
    ss_set is the current Salem-Spencer set (default is None).
    """
    if ss_set is None:
        ss_set = set()

    # Count the frequency of k in the range [1, n]
    freq = sum(1 for i in range(1, n + 1) if i % k == 0)

    # Calculate the priority based on frequency and the size of the current Salem-Spencer set
    priority = freq / (n * len(ss_set) + 1)

    return priority
```

This version of `priority_v1` takes the current `ss_set` as an argument, allowing it to be used in an iterative process to improve the priority calculation over time. The priority is calculated as the frequency of `k` divided by the product of `n` and the size of the current `ss_set`, plus 1 to avoid division by zero when `ss_set` is empty.
