Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the number of unique remainders when dividing `k` by `n`, and the number of multiples of `k` within `n`. This version is more concise and makes small changes to the original function.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  remainders = set((k % i) for i in range(1, n + 1))
  multiples = sum(i for i in range(1, n + 1) if i % k == 0)
  return len(remainders) * multiples
```

This version first calculates the set of unique remainders when dividing `k` by all integers from 1 to `n`. Then, it counts the number of multiples of `k` within the range 1 to `n`. The priority is calculated as the product of the number of unique remainders and the number of multiples, which should give a higher priority to numbers that have many unique remainders and are frequently multiples within the range.
