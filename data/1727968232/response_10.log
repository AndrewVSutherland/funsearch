Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]` and the number of multiples of `k` within that range. This version also uses the `np.sum` function to calculate the sum more efficiently.

```python
import numpy as np

def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  freq = np.sum(np.arange(1, n + 1) % k == 0)
  multiples = (n - 1) // k
  return freq / (multiples + 1)
```

This version of `priority_v1` makes a small change from `priority_v0` by considering the frequency of multiples of `k` and the number of unique multiples within the range `[1, n]`. The priority is calculated as the frequency divided by the number of unique multiples plus one, which helps to avoid division by zero when `k` has no multiples within the range.
