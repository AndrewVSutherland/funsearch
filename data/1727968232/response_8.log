Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the number of unique remainders when dividing `k` by `n`, and the number of multiples of `k` less than `n`. This version is shorter and makes small changes to improve the priority calculation.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  remainders = set(k % i for i in range(1, n))
  multiples = sum(1 for i in range(1, n) if i % k == 0)
  return len(remainders) + multiples
```

This version calculates the priority as the sum of the number of unique remainders and the number of multiples of `k` less than `n`. The `set` data structure is used to efficiently count the unique remainders, and a generator expression is used to count the multiples of `k`.
