Sure, I'd be happy to help you improve your `priority_v1` function. However, it seems that the function's body is missing. Could you please provide more context or specify what improvements you're looking for?

For instance, if you're trying to find large SS progressions, you might want to prioritize numbers that are more likely to lead to a longer progression. This could be based on some mathematical property or heuristic.

Here's a simple example where we prioritize larger numbers and numbers that are closer to the middle of the range:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`. Prioritizes larger numbers and numbers closer to the middle."""
  midpoint = n / 2
  distance_from_midpoint = abs(k - midpoint)
  return k - distance_from_midpoint
```

This function returns a higher priority for larger numbers and numbers that are closer to the midpoint of the range. However, this is a very basic example and may not be suitable for your specific use case. Could you please provide more details?
