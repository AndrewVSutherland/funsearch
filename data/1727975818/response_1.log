```python
import numpy as np

def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`.
    The priority is now calculated as the proportion of the number of integers less than k to the total number of integers.
    """
    return k / n
```
In this improved version, the priority is calculated as the ratio of the number of integers less than k to the total number of integers n. This measure gives a higher priority to larger numbers, which might be beneficial in finding large progressions. However, this method still lacks consideration for the actual properties of Salem-Spencer numbers and their progressions, which would require a more sophisticated approach.
