This problem is about finding large Salem-Spencer (SS) progressions. The SS progressions are sequences of numbers in which the difference between any two consecutive numbers is greater than the difference between the smallest and the second-smallest numbers in the sequence. The task is to improve a priority function that determines the order in which numbers should be added to the SS set.

Here's an improved version of the `priority_v0` function:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`.

  The improved version considers the ratio of the difference between k and the smallest number in the set to the size of the set. A larger ratio indicates a larger gap between k and the existing numbers in the set, which is desirable for SS progressions.
  """
  ss_set = get_ss_set(n)  # This function is not provided in the problem statement, so you would need to implement it.
  min_in_set = min(ss_set) if ss_set else k
  return (k - min_in_set) / (len(ss_set) + 1) if ss_set else 0.0
```

This version of the function calculates the priority of adding `k` to the SS set based on the ratio of the difference between `k` and the smallest number in the set to the size of the set. If the set is empty, the function returns 0.0, which is the same as the original version.

Note that the `get_ss_set` function is not provided in the problem statement, so you would need to implement it. This function should return the current SS set.

The priority function is used to guide the search for SS progressions. The number with the highest priority is added to the set in each iteration. The function should be improved iteratively, with each version making small changes and improving upon the previous version.
