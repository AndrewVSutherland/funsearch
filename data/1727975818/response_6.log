In order to improve the `priority_v1` function over `priority_v0`, we could consider the concept of "progression" in number theory. A progression is a sequence of numbers that increases according to a regular pattern. In this context, a large SS progression would be a sequence of numbers that forms a progression and contains a large number of elements.

Given that, we could modify the `priority_v1` function to return a higher priority for numbers that are more likely to be part of a large SS progression. One way to do this could be to prioritize numbers that have more prime factors, as these are more likely to be part of a progression. However, we also need to consider the total number of possible integers `n`, to ensure that the priority is still meaningful when dealing with larger sets.

Here's a possible implementation:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  # Count the number of prime factors of k
  i = 2
  factors = 0
  while i * i <= k:
    if k % i:
      i += 1
    else:
      k //= i
      factors += 1
  if k > 1:
    factors += 1

  # Normalize the priority by the total number of possible integers
  return factors / n
```

This function first counts the number of prime factors of `k` by dividing `k` by all numbers up to its square root. It then normalizes this count by dividing it by the total number of possible integers `n`. The result is a priority value between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates that the number is most likely to be part of a large SS progression.
