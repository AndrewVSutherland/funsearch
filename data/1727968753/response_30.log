Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that builds upon `priority_v0`. I've made small changes to incorporate the growth rate of the frequency over time, giving more priority to elements that are growing faster.

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v1`."""
    frequency = sum(1 for i in range(n) if i == k)
    growth_rate = (frequency - sum(1 for i in range(k - 1) if i == k - 1)) / (k - (k - 1))
    momentum = (frequency - sum(1 for i in range(k - 2) if i == k - 2)) / (k - (k - 2)) if k > 1 else 0
    return frequency / n + growth_rate + 0.5 * momentum
```

In this version, `momentum` is added to the priority, which is the growth rate of the growth rate. This gives an even stronger preference to elements that are rapidly increasing in frequency. The weight of the momentum term is set to 0.5, but you can adjust this value as needed.
