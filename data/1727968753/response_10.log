Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]` and the number of elements in the Salem-Spencer set. This version uses the `numpy` library for efficient calculations.

```python
import numpy as np

def priority_v1(k: int, n: int, ss_set: set) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`.

    Args:
        k (int): The integer to determine priority for.
        n (int): The number of possible integers.
        ss_set (set): The current Salem-Spencer set.

    Returns:
        float: The priority for adding `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.
    """
    freq_k = np.count_nonzero(np.arange(1, n + 1) == k)  # Frequency of k in [1, n]
    return freq_k / (n * len(ss_set) + 1)  # Priority is inversely proportional to the size of the SS set and directly proportional to the frequency of k
```

This version of `priority_v1` makes a small change by considering the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]` and the size of the current Salem-Spencer set. The priority is calculated as the frequency of `k` divided by the product of `n` and the size of the SS set, plus 1 to avoid division by zero when the SS set is empty.
