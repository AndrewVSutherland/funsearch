Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]` and the number of missing integers in that range. This version is shorter and makes a small change from `priority_v0`.

```python
from collections import Counter

@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Returns the priority with which we want to add `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.
  n is the number of possible integers, and k is the integer we want to determine priority for.
  """
  freq = Counter(range(1, n + 1)).get(k, 0)
  missing = n - len(set(range(1, n + 1)))
  return freq + missing
```

This version uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]`. It also calculates the number of missing integers in that range by subtracting the length of the set of integers in the range from `n`. The priority is then the sum of the frequency and the number of missing integers.
