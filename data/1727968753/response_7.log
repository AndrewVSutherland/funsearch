Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[0, n-1]` and the number of remaining elements. This version is shorter and makes a small change from `priority_v0`.

```python
from collections import Counter

@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Returns the priority with which we want to add `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.
  n is the number of possible integers, and k is the integer we want to determine priority for.
  """
  # Count the frequency of each integer in the range [0, n-1]
  counts = Counter(range(n))

  # Calculate priority based on the frequency of k and the number of remaining elements
  priority = counts[k] / (n - k) if k < n else 0.0

  return priority
```

This version uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each integer in the range `[0, n-1]`. The priority is then calculated as the ratio of the frequency of `k` to the number of remaining elements (`n - k`), or 0 if `k` is not in the range.
