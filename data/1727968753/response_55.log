Here's an improved version of `priority_v2` that reduces the number of iterations and uses numpy for efficient calculations:

```python
import numpy as np

def priority_v3(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v2`."""
    i = np.arange(1, n + 1)
    freq_k = np.sum(i % k == 0)
    freq_kk = np.sum(i % (k * k) == 0)
    freq_kkk = np.sum(i % (k * k * k) == 0)
    return (freq_k + freq_kk - freq_kkk) / n
```

This version reduces the number of iterations by calculating the frequencies in a single pass using numpy's vectorized operations. It also includes an additional term `freq_kkk` to improve the priority calculation, similar to `priority_v0`.

To further improve the code, we can use numpy's built-in functions to calculate the frequencies more efficiently:

```python
def priority_v4(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v3`."""
    i = np.arange(1, n + 1)
    freq_k = np.count_nonzero(i % k == 0)
    freq_kk = np.count_nonzero(i % (k * k) == 0)
    freq_kkk = np.count_nonzero(i % (k * k * k) == 0)
    return (freq_k + freq_kk - freq_kkk) / n
```

This version uses `np.count_nonzero` to count the number of non-zero elements in the boolean arrays, which is more efficient than using `np.sum` with a condition.
