Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the number of elements less than `k` and the total number of elements `n`. This version uses the harmonic series to calculate the priority, which is a common approach in Salem-Spencer problems.

```python
import math

def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0` using harmonic series."""
    return math.log(n + 1) - math.log(k + 1)
```

This version makes a small change from `priority_v0` by introducing a simple logarithmic function that considers the position of `k` among the `n` possible integers. The harmonic series is used to give higher priority to smaller integers, as they are more likely to be part of a large Salem-Spencer progression.

To further improve the function, you can consider other factors that might affect the priority, such as the number of Salem-Spencer progressions that include `k`. However, keep in mind that the goal is to make small changes on each iteration, so avoid significant modifications at once.

For example, you can add a factor that considers the number of progressions that include `k` by using the `funsearch` library to find and count these progressions:

```python
import math

def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v1` considering the number of progressions that include `k`."""
    progressions = funsearch.find_progression(k, n)
    return math.log(n + 1) - math.log(k + 1) + math.log(len(progressions) + 1)
```

In this version, `funsearch.find_progression(k, n)` is assumed to return a list of Salem-Spencer progressions that include the integer `k`. The number of progressions is added to the priority calculation using the logarithm to maintain a small change from the previous version.
