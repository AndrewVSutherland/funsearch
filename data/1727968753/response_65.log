Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]` and the number of multiples of `k` within that range. This version is shorter and makes small changes to `priority_v0`.

```python
from collections import Counter

@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Returns the priority with which we want to add `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.
    n is the number of possible integers, and k is the integer we want to determine priority for.
    """
    freq = Counter(range(1, n + 1)).get(k, 0)
    multiples = sum(1 for i in range(1, n // k + 1))
    return freq + multiples
```

This version first counts the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]` using `Counter`. Then, it calculates the number of multiples of `k` within that range. The priority is the sum of these two values.
