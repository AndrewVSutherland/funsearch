Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the Salem-Spencer set and the number of unique elements in the set so far. I've made small changes to keep the code short and focused on improving the priority function.

```python
import itertools
import numpy as np
import funsearch

@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int, ss_set: set = None) -> float:
    """Returns the priority with which we want to add `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.
    n is the number of possible integers, and k is the integer we want to determine priority for.
    ss_set is the current Salem-Spencer set (default is None).
    """
    if ss_set is None:
        ss_set = set()

    # Calculate frequency of k in the set
    freq_k = ss_set.count(k)

    # Calculate unique elements in the set
    unique_elements = len(ss_set)

    # Priority function: prefer elements with higher frequency and fewer unique elements
    priority = (freq_k / n) - (unique_elements / n)

    return priority
```

This version of `priority_v1` uses the frequency of `k` in the current Salem-Spencer set and the number of unique elements in the set to calculate the priority. The priority is higher for elements with a higher frequency and fewer unique elements in the set. This should improve the search process by favoring elements that are more likely to lead to a larger Salem-Spencer set.
