Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[0, n)` and the number of unique elements in that range. This version is shorter and makes small changes to `priority_v0`.

```python
from collections import Counter

def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  freq = Counter(range(n)).get(k, 0)
  unique_elements = len(set(range(n)))
  return freq / unique_elements
```

This version calculates the frequency of `k` in the range `[0, n)` using `Counter` and divides it by the number of unique elements in that range. This should give a higher priority to elements that appear more frequently and are unique.
