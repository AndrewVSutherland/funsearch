Here's a step-by-step improvement of the `priority_v1` function based on the given instructions. I've made small changes to improve the priority calculation while keeping the code short.

```python
@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  freq = sum(1 for i in range(k+1) if i == k)  # Calculate frequency up to k
  growth_rate = (freq - sum(1 for i in range(k) if i == k - 1)) / (k - (k - 1)) if k > 0 else 0  # Improved growth rate calculation
  return freq / n + growth_rate  # Return the priority
```

Changes made:

1. Simplified the frequency calculation by iterating up to `k` instead of `n`.
2. Improved the growth rate calculation by adding a check for `k > 0` to avoid division by zero.
3. Removed unnecessary comments and made the code shorter.
