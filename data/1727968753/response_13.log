Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the number of elements in the Salem-Spencer set that are coprime with `k`. This version uses the `math.gcd` function to calculate the greatest common divisor and the `itertools.count` function to generate a count of coprime elements.

```python
import math
import itertools

@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Returns the priority with which we want to add `k` to the salem-spencer set.
    n is the number of possible integers, and k is the integer we want to determine priority for.
    """
    coprimes = sum(1 for i in itertools.count() if math.gcd(k, i) == 1)
    return coprimes / n
```

This version of `priority_v1` should provide a better estimate of the priority for adding `k` to the Salem-Spencer set, as it considers the number of elements that are coprime with `k`. The function returns the ratio of coprime elements to the total number of possible integers `n`, which should give a higher priority to integers with more coprime elements.
