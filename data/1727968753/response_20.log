Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the number of unique remainders when dividing `k` by `n` and the number of multiples of `k` within `n`. This version is shorter and makes small changes to `priority_v0`.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  remainders = set(k % i for i in range(1, n + 1))
  multiples = sum(1 for i in range(1, n + 1) if i % k == 0)
  return len(remainders) + multiples
```

This version first calculates the set of unique remainders when dividing `k` by each integer from 1 to `n`. Then, it counts the number of multiples of `k` within the range from 1 to `n`. The priority is the sum of the number of unique remainders and multiples of `k`.

To further improve the function, you can consider other factors that might affect the priority, such as the distribution of remainders or the proximity of multiples to `k`. Here's an example of a slightly improved version that considers the average distance of multiples to `k`:

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Further improved version of `priority_v1`."""
  remainders = set(k % i for i in range(1, n + 1))
  multiples = [i for i in range(1, n + 1) if i % k == 0]
  avg_distance = sum(abs(m - k) for m in multiples) / len(multiples) if multiples else 0
  return len(remainders) + len(multiples) - avg_distance
```

This version calculates the average distance of multiples to `k` and subtracts it from the sum of the number of unique remainders and multiples. This might help prioritize cases where multiples are closer to `k`, making them more likely to be added to the Salem-Spencer set.
