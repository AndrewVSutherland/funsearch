Here's a step-by-step improvement of the `priority_vX` functions, focusing on finding large Salem-Spencer progressions. I've made small changes on each iteration to improve the priority function. I've also used the `numpy` library for efficient numerical operations.

1. **priority_v0**: Initial version that simply returns 0.0.

```python
@funsearch.run
def priority_v0(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    return 0.0
```

2. **priority_v1**: First improvement, consider the density of Salem-Spencer progressions around `k`.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    density = np.sum([1 for i in range(1, n - k + 1) if funsearch.is_salem_spencer(i, k)]) / (n - k)
    return density
```

3. **priority_v2**: Second improvement, consider the length of the longest Salem-Spencer progression around `k`.

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    max_length = 0
    for i in range(1, n - k + 1):
        if funsearch.is_salem_spencer(i, k):
            length = 1
            while i + length < n and funsearch.is_salem_spencer(i + length, k):
                length += 1
            max_length = max(max_length, length)
    return max_length
```

4. **priority_v3**: Third improvement, consider the average length of Salem-Spencer progressions around `k`.

```python
def priority_v3(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    total_length = 0
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n - k + 1):
        if funsearch.is_salem_spencer(i, k):
            length = 1
            while i + length < n and funsearch.is_salem_spencer(i + length, k):
                length += 1
            total_length += length
            count += 1
    return total_length / count if count > 0 else 0
```

5. **priority_v4**: Fourth improvement, consider the product of the density and the average length of Salem-Spencer progressions around `k`.

```python
def priority_v4(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    density = np.sum([1 for i in range(1, n - k + 1) if funsearch.is_salem_spencer(i, k)]) / (n - k)
    total_length = 0
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n - k + 1):
        if funsearch.is_salem_spencer(i, k):
            length = 1
            while i + length < n and funsearch.is_salem_spencer(i + length, k):
                length += 1
            total_length += length
            count += 1
    avg_length = total_length / count if count > 0 else 0
    return density * avg_length
```

These improvements focus on finding large Salem-Spencer progressions by considering the density, length, and average length of progressions around `k`. The final version, `priority_v4`, combines density and average length to provide a more comprehensive priority measure.
