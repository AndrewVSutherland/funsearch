Here's an improved version of `priority_v2` with small changes made on each iteration. I've also added type hints and docstring improvements for better readability. The code is kept short by using numpy's vectorized operations and avoiding explicit loops.

```python
import numpy as np

def priority_v3(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Returns the priority with which we want to add `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.

    Args:
        k (int): The integer for which we want to determine the priority.
        n (int): The number of possible integers.

    Returns:
        float: The priority value.
    """
    # Create an array of integers from 1 to n
    arr = np.arange(1, n + 1)

    # Calculate frequencies using numpy's vectorized operations
    freq_k = np.count_nonzero(arr % k == 0)
    freq_kk = np.count_nonzero(arr[::k] % k == 0)
    freq_kkk = np.count_nonzero(arr[::k**2] % k == 0)
    freq_kkkk = np.count_nonzero(arr[::k**3] % k == 0)

    # Calculate and return the priority value
    return (freq_k + freq_kk - freq_kkk + freq_kkkk) / n
```

This version, `priority_v3`, is an improved version of `priority_v2` with the following changes:

1. Added type hints for better readability and static analysis.
2. Improved the docstring to explain the purpose, arguments, and return value of the function.
3. Used numpy's vectorized operations to calculate frequencies, avoiding explicit loops.
4. Simplified the array indexing for calculating `freq_kk`, `freq_kkk`, and `freq_kkkk`.
