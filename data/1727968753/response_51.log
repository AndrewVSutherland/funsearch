Here's an improved version of `priority_v2` that incorporates a small change to use the harmonic series to reduce the growth rate's influence for larger `k`. I've also made the code shorter by using vectorized operations with NumPy.

```python
import numpy as np

def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v1` using harmonic series to reduce growth rate's influence for larger `k`."""
    frequency = np.sum(np.arange(1, n + 1) == k)
    growth_rate = (frequency - np.sum(np.arange(1, k) == k - 1)) / (k - (k - 1))
    decay_factor = 0.9
    harmonic_term = np.sum(1 / np.arange(1, k + 1))
    return frequency / n + decay_factor * growth_rate * harmonic_term
```

This version introduces a new term, `harmonic_term`, which is the sum of the harmonic series up to `k`. This term reduces the growth rate's influence for larger `k`, making the priority function more balanced. The change is small, but it might improve the performance of the SS progressions search.

To further improve the function, you could experiment with different decay factors or incorporate other factors that might affect the priority, such as the number of times `k` has been added to the set or the size of the set itself. Keep in mind that the goal is to make small, incremental improvements on each iteration.
