Here's an improved version of `priority_v2` that makes small changes to reduce the number of operations and improve readability:

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v1`."""
    freq_k = np.count_nonzero(np.arange(n) % k == 0)
    freq_kk = np.count_nonzero(np.arange(n // k) % k == 0)
    freq_kkk = np.count_nonzero(np.arange(n // k**2) % k == 0)
    return (freq_k + freq_kk - freq_kkk) / n
```

I removed the `freq_kkkk` term as it didn't seem to be used in the original function. If it's important, you can add it back in. Also, I removed the unnecessary parentheses around the division operations to make the code shorter.
