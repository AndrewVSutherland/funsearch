Here's a version of `priority_v2` that builds upon `priority_v1` with a small change. I've added a simple exponential decay factor to the growth rate to give more weight to recent growth:

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v1` with exponential decay for growth rate."""
  frequency = sum(1 for i in range(n) if i == k)
  growth_rate = (frequency - sum(1 for i in range(k) if i == k - 1)) / (k - (k - 1))
  decay_factor = 0.9  # You can adjust this value to control the decay rate
  return frequency / n + decay_factor * growth_rate
```

This version should give a slightly different priority value compared to `priority_v1`, putting more emphasis on the recent growth rate. The decay factor determines how much influence the growth rate from the previous iteration has on the current priority. A smaller decay factor will give more weight to recent growth, while a larger decay factor will consider growth over a longer period.
