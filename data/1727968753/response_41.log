Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the first `n` integers and the number of integers that are coprime with `k`. This version is shorter and makes a small change from `priority_v0`.

```python
from math import gcd

@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Returns the priority with which we want to add `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.
    n is the number of possible integers, and k is the integer we want to determine priority for.
    """
    freq = sum(1 for i in range(1, n+1) if i % k == 0)  # Frequency of k in first n integers
    coprime_count = sum(gcd(i, k) == 1 for i in range(1, n+1))  # Count of integers coprime with k
    return freq * coprime_count
```

This version assumes that you want to prioritize integers that appear frequently in the first `n` integers and have many coprime numbers. You can adjust the formula as needed to better fit your specific use case.
