Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[0, n)` and the number of elements that can be added to the Salem-Spencer set by including `k`. This version uses the `itertools.combinations` function to count the number of combinations that can be formed with `k` and other elements.

```python
from typing import List

def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
    # Count the frequency of k in the range [0, n)
    freq_k = sum(1 for i in range(n) if i == k)

    # Count the number of elements that can be added by including k
    elements = [i for i in range(n) if i != k]
    num_elements = len(elements)
    num_combinations = sum(len(list(itertools.combinations(elements, r))) for r in range(num_elements + 1))

    # Calculate the priority as the product of frequency and number of combinations
    return freq_k * num_combinations
```

This version of `priority_v1` makes small changes to the original `priority_v0` function by adding logic to calculate the frequency of `k` and the number of combinations that can be formed with `k` and other elements. The priority is then calculated as the product of these two values.
