Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[0, n)` and the total number of possible integers `n`. This version uses the formula `priority = frequency / n` to calculate the priority.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  frequency = sum(1 for i in range(n) if i == k)
  return frequency / n
```

To further improve the function, we can consider the growth rate of the frequency as `k` increases. We can estimate this growth rate by calculating the average frequency increase per unit increase in `k`. Here's an updated version that considers this growth rate:

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Further improved version of `priority_v1`."""
  frequency = sum(1 for i in range(n) if i == k)
  growth_rate = (frequency - sum(1 for i in range(k) if i == k - 1)) / (k - (k - 1))
  return frequency / n + growth_rate
```

This version adds the growth rate to the priority, giving more weight to integers that are likely to have a higher frequency in larger ranges.
