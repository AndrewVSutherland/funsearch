Here's an improved version of `priority_v2` that reduces the number of operations and uses a single loop to calculate the frequencies:

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v1`."""
  freq_k, freq_kk, freq_kkk = 0, 0, 0
  for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if i % k == 0:
      freq_k += 1
      if i % (k * k) == 0:
        freq_kkk += 1
    if i % (k * k) == 0:
      freq_kk += 1
  return (freq_k + freq_kk - freq_kkk) / n
```

This version of the function performs the same calculations as `priority_v1` but with fewer operations, making it more efficient. It also follows the guidance of making only small changes to improve the code.
