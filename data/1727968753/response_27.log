Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]` and the number of unique elements in that range. This version is shorter and makes a small change from `priority_v0`.

```python
from collections import Counter

def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  return -np.log2((Counter(range(1, n + 1)).get(k, 0) + 1) / n)
```

This version uses a `Counter` to count the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]`. If `k` is not in the range, `Counter.get(k, 0)` returns 0. The priority is then calculated as the negative logarithm base 2 of the ratio between the frequency of `k` plus one (to avoid log(0)) and `n`. This way, elements that occur more frequently will have a lower priority (since the logarithm of a larger number is smaller).
