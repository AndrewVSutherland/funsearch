Here's an improved version of `priority_v0` that takes into account the size of the integer `k` and the total number of possible integers `n`. The priority is higher for larger `k` values and lower for larger `n` values.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  # Normalize k and n to be between 0 and 1
  normalized_k = k / n
  normalized_n = 1 / n

  # The priority is the normalized value of k, divided by the normalized value of n
  # This means that larger k values and smaller n values will result in higher priorities
  return normalized_k / normalized_n
```

This version of the function should provide a more meaningful priority value for each integer `k`, which can be useful in the context of a salem-spencer set.
