Based on the problem description, the function `priority_v1` is expected to be an improvement over `priority_v0`. However, there's no specific guidance on how to improve the priority function. Given that, I'll provide an example of how you might use the number of factors of `k` and its proximity to `n/2` to determine priority.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  # Calculate the number of factors of k
  factors = sum(1 for i in range(1, k + 1) if k % i == 0)

  # Calculate the distance of k from n/2
  distance = abs(k - n / 2)

  # The priority is inversely proportional to the number of factors and the distance
  priority = 1 / (factors * (distance + 1))

  return priority
```

This `priority_v1` function calculates the number of factors of `k` and its distance from `n/2`. The priority is then the inverse of the product of these two values. This gives higher priority to numbers with fewer factors and that are closer to `n/2`.
