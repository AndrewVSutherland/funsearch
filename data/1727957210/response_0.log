Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the number of elements in the cap set and the number of elements that can still be added. This version also uses the `itertools.product` function to generate all possible combinations of elements that can be added to the cap set.

```python
import itertools
import numpy as np

def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Returns the priority with which we want to add `element` to the cap set.
  el is a tuple of length n with values 0-2.
  """
  cap_set = np.zeros(n, dtype=int)
  remaining_elements = np.setdiff1d(np.arange(n), np.where(cap_set)[0])

  for r in range(1, k + 1):
    for combo in itertools.combinations(remaining_elements, r):
      cap_set[list(combo)] = 1

  return np.sum(cap_set)
```

This version of `priority_v1` iterates through all possible combinations of elements that can be added to the cap set, starting with the smallest combination (a single element) and increasing the size of the combination up to `k`. For each combination, it adds the elements to the cap set and calculates the sum of the cap set, which is returned as the priority.
