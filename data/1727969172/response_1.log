Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]` and the number of possible progressions that can be formed using `k`. This version uses the `itertools.combinations` function to count progressions.

```python
from collections import Counter

@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Returns the priority with which we want to add `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.
    n is the number of possible integers, and k is the integer we want to determine priority for.
    """
    freq = sum(1 for i in range(1, n + 1) if i % k == 0)  # Frequency of k in [1, n]
    progressions = sum(len(list(itertools.combinations(range(1, n + 1), r))) for r in range(1, n + 1))  # Total possible progressions
    return freq / progressions if progressions > 0 else 0.0
```

This version of `priority_v1` makes small changes to `priority_v0` by adding the frequency calculation and progression counting. It also avoids division by zero by checking if `progressions` is greater than zero before performing the division.
