It seems like you're working on a function that calculates a priority value for a given integer `k` in the context of a Salem-Spencer set, which is a set of integers that satisfies certain mathematical properties. The priority value is used to determine the order in which to add `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.

The function `priority_v1` should improve upon the initial version `priority_v0`. However, since `priority_v0` is not provided, I can't see exactly how to improve it.

Generally, in such a function, the priority could be based on various factors such as the size of `k`, its divisors, its position in the sequence of integers, or any other mathematical property that might be relevant.

Here's a simple example of how `priority_v1` might look:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`.

  In this version, the priority is higher for larger numbers and for numbers that have fewer divisors.
  """
  divisors = [i for i in range(1, k + 1) if k % i == 0]
  return k / len(divisors)
```

This function calculates the priority as the ratio of the number `k` to the number of its divisors. The idea is that larger numbers and numbers with fewer divisors are more likely to be added to the Salem-Spencer set, so they should have a higher priority.
