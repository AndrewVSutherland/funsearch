The requirements seem to suggest that we should improve the function `priority_v0` to `priority_v1` by slightly modifying it. The priority seems to be related to the integer `k` and the number of possible integers `n`.

In the improved version, I will use a simple heuristic: the higher the integer `k`, the lower its priority. This is based on the assumption that higher numbers are less likely to be part of a large progression in a Salem-Spencer set.

Here's a simple implementation:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  return 1.0 / (k + 1)
```

This function returns a priority that is inversely proportional to `k`. As `k` increases, the priority decreases, which is the desired behavior. The constant `1` in the denominator is to avoid division by zero when `k` is zero.

Please note that this is a very basic approach and may not be optimal for all situations. The choice of priority function depends on the specifics of the problem and the constraints.

Let's execute this code now.
```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  return 1.0 / (k + 1)

# Testing the function with some values
print(priority_v1(0, 10))
print(priority_v1(5, 10))
print(priority_v1(9, 10))
```
