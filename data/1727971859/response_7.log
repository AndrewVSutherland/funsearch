To improve the `priority_v1` function over the `priority_v0` method, we can consider the following changes:

1. Use the integer `k` to calculate the priority.
2. Incorporate the number of possible integers `n` into the calculation.

Here's an improved version of the `priority_v1` function:

```python
import math

def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
    # Calculate the priority based on the integer k and the number of possible integers n
    priority = k / n
    return priority
```

In this improved version, the priority is calculated as the ratio of the integer `k` to the total number of possible integers `n`. This means that larger integers will have a higher priority, and the priority will be normalized between 0 and 1.

Let's execute the code to see if it runs without any errors.
```python
import math

def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
    # Calculate the priority based on the integer k and the number of possible integers n
    priority = k / n
    return priority

# Test the function with some example values
print(priority_v1(5, 10))  # Expected output: 0.5
print(priority_v1(9, 15))  # Expected output: 0.6
```
