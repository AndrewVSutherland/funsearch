Here's an improved version of `priority_v0` that takes into account the size of the integer `k` and the total number of possible integers `n`:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Returns the priority with which we want to add `k` to the salem-spencer set.
  n is the number of possible integers, and k is the integer we want to determine priority for.
  """
  # Normalize k to be between 0 and 1
  normalized_k = k / n

  # Prioritize larger numbers and numbers closer to 1
  return 1 - abs(normalized_k - 0.5)
```

This version of the function prioritizes numbers that are closer to the middle of the range (0.5 when normalized) and gives higher priority to larger numbers. This is because larger numbers are more likely to be part of a large SS progression.
