Sure, I'd be happy to help you improve your priority function. Here's a simple way to do it:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`.

  This version returns a priority based on the proportion of the total possible integers that k represents.
  The higher the proportion, the higher the priority.
  """
  return k / n
```

This function will return a value between 0 and 1, where 1 represents the highest priority (when k is equal to n) and 0 represents the lowest priority (when k is 0). This should provide a more meaningful priority score compared to the previous version.
