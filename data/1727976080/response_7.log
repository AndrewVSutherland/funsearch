Here's a potential improvement on `priority_v0` in `priority_v1`:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  # Give high priority to numbers closer to the middle of the range
  mid_point = n // 2
  return 1.0 - abs(k - mid_point) / mid_point
```

This function calculates the absolute difference between `k` and the middle point of the range (`n // 2`) and normalises it by dividing it by the mid point. The result is subtracted from 1 to give high priority to numbers close to the middle of the range.
