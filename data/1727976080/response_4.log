The `priority_v1` function is intended to improve the priority calculation from `priority_v0`. However, the function body of `priority_v1` is missing. I'll assume an improved priority calculation could be based on a weighted average of the integer's value and its frequency in the set of possible integers. This could potentially provide a more balanced priority score. Here's an example:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int, freq: dict) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`.
  The priority is a weighted average of the integer's value and its frequency in the set of possible integers.
  freq is a dictionary that maps each integer to its frequency in the set.
  """
  value_weight = 0.5
  freq_weight = 0.5
  value_priority = (n - k) / n
  freq_priority = 1 / freq[k] if k in freq else 0
  return value_weight * value_priority + freq_weight * freq_priority
```

In this version, `freq` is a dictionary that maps each integer to its frequency in the set of possible integers. This allows us to take into account the rarity of each integer when calculating priority. The `value_weight` and `freq_weight` variables determine the relative importance of the integer's value and its frequency. These weights should be adjusted according to the specific requirements of the problem.
