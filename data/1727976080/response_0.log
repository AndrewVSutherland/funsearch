Here we are improving the priority_v0 function to determine the priority of adding an integer 'k' to the Salem-Spencer set. The priority is based on the number of possible integers 'n' and the value of 'k' itself. Our goal is to find large SS progressions, so we want to prioritize larger values of 'k'.

One way to do this is to use the ratio of 'k' to 'n' as the priority. This way, larger 'k' values will have a higher priority when 'n' is large. However, since we want to make small changes, we can modify this ratio slightly by adding 1 to 'k' before dividing by 'n'. This ensures that even small 'k' values have some priority.

Here is the improved function:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`. Prioritizes larger 'k' values."""
  return (k + 1) / n
```

This function still returns a float between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as a priority. Larger 'k' values will have a higher priority, and smaller 'k' values will have a lower priority.
