Below is the improved version of the `priority_v0` function:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  # Calculate the ratio of k to n
  ratio = k / n
  # Prioritize numbers closer to 1
  return 1 - abs(ratio - 1)
```

The `priority_v1` function calculates the ratio of `k` to `n`, and then returns a priority score which is higher for numbers closer to 1. This means that numbers closer to the midpoint of the range are preferred over numbers closer to the ends.

Note that this is a simple heuristic and may not be the best priority function for all applications. It's always a good idea to think about the specific problem you're trying to solve when designing a priority function.
