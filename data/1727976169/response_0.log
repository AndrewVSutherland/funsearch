Here is a possible implementation for `priority_v1` that focuses on finding large SS progressions. It assigns a higher priority to numbers that are closer to the middle of the range and to numbers that have a larger difference with their neighbors in the SS set.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, ss_set: list, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
    # Assign a higher priority to numbers closer to the middle of the range
    middle_priority = 1 - abs(k - n // 2) / (n // 2)

    # If the SS set is not empty, assign a higher priority to numbers with a larger difference
    # with their neighbors in the SS set
    difference_priority = 0
    if ss_set:
        differences = [abs(k - ss) for ss in ss_set]
        difference_priority = min(differences) / max(differences)

    # Combine the two priorities
    return middle_priority + difference_priority
```

In this function, `ss_set` is the current Salem-Spencer set, and it is used to calculate the `difference_priority`. The `middle_priority` is calculated as the distance of `k` from the middle of the range, normalized by the distance from the middle to the edges of the range. The `difference_priority` is calculated as the ratio of the smallest difference between `k` and the numbers in the `ss_set` to the largest difference. The final priority is the sum of the two priorities.

This implementation should help the algorithm to find larger SS progressions, as it prefers numbers that are closer to the middle of the range and that have a larger difference with their neighbors in the SS set.
