Here is an improved version of the `priority_v0` function, which assigns a priority to an integer `k` based on its divisors and the total number of possible integers `n`. The function calculates the sum of divisors of `k`, and then returns the ratio of this sum to `n`. Integers with more divisors are given a higher priority.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  def divisors(n):
    result = set()
    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
      if n % i == 0:
        result.add(i)
        result.add(n // i)
    return result

  return sum(divisors(k)) / n
```

This function first defines a helper function `divisors` that finds all divisors of a given integer `n`. It then calculates the sum of these divisors and divides it by `n` to get the priority.
