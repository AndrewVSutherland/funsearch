To improve the `priority_v1` function over `priority_v0`, I will consider the following:

1. I'll assign higher priority to tuples that have more 1's and 2's, as these values contribute to the sum of the cap set.
2. To account for the constraint that the sum of the elements in the tuple should be less than or equal to n, I'll subtract the sum of the elements from n to get a penalty.
3. To give importance to the order of elements in the tuple, I'll consider the position of 1's and 2's. For instance, a 2 in a higher position has a more significant impact on the sum than a 2 in a lower position.

I'll use the numpy library to calculate the sum of the elements in the tuple and the penalty. I'll also consider the position of 1's and 2's by multiplying them with their corresponding positions.

Here is the improved `priority_v1` function:

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
  penalties = [0 if x == 0 else x * (n - i) for i, x in enumerate(el)]
  return sum(penalties)
```

This function calculates the penalty for each non-zero element in the tuple based on its position and value. The priority of the tuple is then the sum of these penalties, with higher values indicating higher priority.
