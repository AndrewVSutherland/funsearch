The given code seems to be a part of a larger system that involves finding "large cap sets". However, the `priority_v1` function is not implemented. I'll provide an improved version of the `priority_v0` function as a starting point for `priority_v1`.

The `priority_v0` function currently returns 0.0 for all elements, which means that all elements have the same priority and are treated equally. In a cap set problem, we might want to prioritize elements that have more unique elements (1's) or fewer overlapping elements (2's) with the existing cap set.

Here's a simple improvement that prioritizes elements with more unique elements:

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
  """Returns the priority with which we want to add `element` to the cap set.
  el is a tuple of length n with values 0-2.
  """
  return el.count(1)  # Prioritize elements with more unique elements
```

This new implementation counts the number of unique elements (1's) in the tuple and uses that as the priority. Elements with more unique elements will have a higher priority.
