Sure, I'd be happy to help you improve your `priority_v1` function. It seems like you're working with a cap set, which is a subset of a larger set that has certain properties. In this context, the `priority_v1` function is likely used to determine the order in which elements are added to the cap set.

Here's a simple improvement that takes into account the number of 2s and 1s in the tuple `el`. The idea is that elements with more 2s and 1s are more likely to contribute to the properties of a cap set and should be added earlier.

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  return el.count(2) + el.count(1)
```

This function counts the number of 2s and 1s in `el` and returns their sum as the priority. Elements with more 2s and 1s will have a higher priority.
