Here's the improved version of `priority_v0` to `priority_v1`. The improvement is to assign a higher priority to elements that have more 2s. This is because having more 2s in the cap set will result in a larger cap set.

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  return el.count(2)
```

This version of the function counts the number of 2s in the tuple and returns that count as the priority. An element with more 2s will have a higher priority and is more likely to be added to the cap set.

However, this function still doesn't consider the other values in the tuple (0s and 1s). A more sophisticated strategy might be to assign different weights to 0s, 1s, and 2s, reflecting their respective contributions to the size of the cap set. This could potentially lead to a more efficient algorithm, but it would make the function more complicated.
