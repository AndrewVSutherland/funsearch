Here is the improved version of `priority_v0`:

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
  """Returns the priority with which we want to add `element` to the cap set.
  el is a tuple of length n with values 0-2.
  """
  # We prioritize elements with more 2's and less 0's
  return el.count(2) - el.count(0)
```

This version of the function gives priority to elements that have more 2's and fewer 0's. The idea is that elements with more 2's contribute more to the size of the cap set, while elements with more 0's contribute less. This could be a reasonable heuristic for a cap set problem, depending on the specifics of the problem at hand.
