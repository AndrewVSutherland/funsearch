Here's a simple approach to improve the `priority_v0` function.

We can assign a priority based on the number of 2's in the tuple `el`. This is because a 2 contributes more to the final sum than a 1 or a 0.

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
  return el.count(2)
```

This will ensure that tuples with more 2's will have a higher priority. If the number of 2's is equal, the priority will be the same.

Remember that we want to make only small changes and that the code should be short.
