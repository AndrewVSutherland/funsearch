Sure, I'd be happy to help you improve your code. In this case, it seems like you're working on a function that calculates a priority score for a given tuple of integers. The priority score is used to determine the order in which elements are added to a cap set.

Here's a simple way to improve `priority_v1` by considering the sum of the elements in the tuple. A higher sum might indicate a higher priority:

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`. Considers the sum of the elements in the tuple."""
    return sum(el)
```

This function takes the sum of all elements in the tuple `el` and returns it as the priority. Elements with higher sums will be considered for addition to the cap set before elements with lower sums.
