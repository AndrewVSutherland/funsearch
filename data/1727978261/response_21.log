To find large cap sets, we can use a greedy algorithm that iteratively adds elements to the cap set based on a priority score. The priority score is calculated using the `priority_v1` function, which is an improved version of the `priority_v0` function.

The `priority_v1` function takes an element `el` and the size `n` of the cap set as input, and returns a floating-point value representing the priority score. This score determines the order in which elements are added to the cap set.

To implement the greedy algorithm, we can start with an empty cap set and iteratively add the element with the highest priority score until the cap set reaches the desired size `n`. To do this, we can use the `itertools.product` function to generate all possible tuples of length `n` with values 0-2, and then sort these tuples based on their priority score.

Here's the improved code:

```python
import itertools

def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
    # Calculate the priority score based on the element and the size of the cap set
    # Modify this function to improve the priority score calculation
    return sum(el) / n

def find_large_cap_set(n: int) -> set[tuple[int, ...]]:
    # Generate all possible tuples of length n with values 0-2
    elements = list(itertools.product(range(3), repeat=n))

    # Sort the elements based on their priority score
    elements.sort(key=lambda el: priority_v1(el, n), reverse=True)

    # Initialize the cap set
    cap_set = set()

    # Iteratively add the element with the highest priority score to the cap set
    for el in elements:
        if len(cap_set) >= n:
            break
        cap_set.add(el)

    return cap_set
```

In this code, the `priority_v1` function calculates the priority score of an element `el` as the average value of its elements. This priority score is used to sort the elements in descending order.

The `find_large_cap_set` function generates all possible tuples of length `n` with values 0-2, sorts them based on their priority score, and then iteratively adds the elements with the highest priority score to the cap set until the cap set reaches the desired size `n`.

You can modify the `priority_v1` function to improve the priority score calculation based on your specific requirements.
