The function `priority_v1` is an improved version of `priority_v0`. However, as the current code doesn't provide any implementation for `priority_v1`, I can't directly improve it.

Improving `priority_v1` could potentially mean different things depending on the context, but generally, it might involve considering the elements in `el` and their frequencies. Based on these frequencies, we might want to prioritize certain combinations of elements more highly.

For example, if `el` is a binary vector, we could count the number of 1s and use this count as the priority. This would prioritize sets with more 1s. Here's a simple implementation of this idea:

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
  return sum(el)
```

However, without more specific requirements or context, it's hard to suggest a more accurate improvement.
