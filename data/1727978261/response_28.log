# The `priority_v10` function considers many different aspects of the tuple, and should be able to find large cap sets efficiently.
# However, it may be overly complex for some applications, and may be slow to compute.
# For simpler applications, or when speed is a concern, the earlier versions of the `priority` function may be sufficient.
