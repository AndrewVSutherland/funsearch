The improved version of `priority_v0` can be created by considering the number of 2's and 1's in the tuple `el`. A simple heuristic could be to prioritize sets with more 2's and then more 1's. This is because a 2 in the tuple contributes to more elements in the cap set, while a 1 contributes to some elements. Here's a possible implementation:

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  # Count the number of 2's and 1's in el
  count_2 = el.count(2)
  count_1 = el.count(1)

  # Prioritize sets with more 2's and then more 1's
  return count_2 * 10 + count_1
```

This function works by first counting the number of 2's and 1's in the tuple `el`, then returning a priority score that is 10 times the number of 2's plus the number of 1's. This means that each 2 in the tuple increases the priority score by 10, while each 1 increases the score by 1. This way, sets with more 2's are prioritized over sets with the same number of 1's, and sets with more 1's are prioritized over sets with fewer 1's but the same number of 2's.
