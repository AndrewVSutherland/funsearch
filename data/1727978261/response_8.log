I will improve the `priority_v0` function to `priority_v1` by adding a priority score that is based on the sum of elements in the tuple. The higher the sum, the higher the priority. This is because a larger sum indicates a more diverse element with more 1s and 2s, which is desirable for a cap set.

Here's the improved function:

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
  return sum(el)
```

This function works by summing all the elements in the tuple and using that sum as the priority value. Elements with more 1s and 2s will have a higher priority, as they contribute more to the sum.
