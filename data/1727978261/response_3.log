The given code defines a function `priority_v0` that takes a tuple `el` and an integer `n` as input and always returns 0.0. The task is to improve this function in a small way to create a new function `priority_v1`.

Since the original function always returns 0.0, it doesn't actually prioritize any elements. To improve it, we need to define a priority based on the input. One possible way to do this is to calculate the sum of the elements in the tuple `el` and return that as the priority. This way, tuples with larger sums will have higher priorities.

Here's an example of how `priority_v1` could be implemented:

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
    return sum(el)
```

This implementation assumes that higher sums are considered more important. If this is not the case, the priority calculation could be adjusted accordingly.
