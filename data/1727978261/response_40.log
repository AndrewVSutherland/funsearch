Here's a possible improvement over `priority_v0`:

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
  """Returns the priority with which we want to add `element` to the cap set.
  el is a tuple of length n with values 0-2.
  """
  # Calculate the sum of the elements in the tuple
  sum_el = sum(el)

  # Calculate the number of unique elements in the tuple
  unique_el = len(set(el))

  # Calculate the priority as the sum of the elements divided by the number of unique elements
  priority = sum_el / unique_el

  return priority
```

This improved version calculates the priority as the sum of the elements in the tuple divided by the number of unique elements in the tuple. This prioritizes tuples with a larger sum and fewer unique elements.
