Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that takes into account the number of elements set to 1 in the tuple:

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`.
  Prioritizes tuples with more elements set to 1, as these are more likely to contribute to a large cap set.
  """
  return el.count(1) / n
```

This version prioritizes tuples with more elements set to 1, as these are more likely to contribute to a large cap set.

The priority is calculated as the ratio of the number of 1s in the tuple to the length of the tuple. This means tuples with more 1s will have a higher priority. If all elements in the tuple are 1s, the priority will be 1.0, which is the highest possible priority.

If all elements in the tuple are 0s, the priority will be 0.0, which is the lowest possible priority.

Tuples with 0s and 2s will have priorities between 0.0 and 1.0, depending on how many 1s they contain.
