```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  # Calculate the sum of elements in the tuple
  sum_el = sum(el)

  # Return the sum as the priority
  return sum_el
```
The `priority_v1` function calculates the sum of elements in the given tuple `el` and returns the sum as the priority. This simple improvement considers the total value of the elements in the tuple when deciding the priority, which may lead to better results in finding large cap sets.
