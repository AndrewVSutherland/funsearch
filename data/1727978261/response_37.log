It seems like you're implementing a function to calculate the priority of adding an element to a cap set. A cap set is a subset of a vector space that has certain properties related to the number of elements that can be added together to get a specific sum.

Your current function `priority_v0` always returns 0.0, which doesn't seem useful for prioritizing elements to add to a cap set.

I've started a new function `priority_v1` for you. Since you didn't provide any specific criteria for improving the priority calculation, I'll implement a simple priority calculation that sums the elements in the tuple. This way, elements with larger sums will have a higher priority. Here's how it looks:

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  return sum(el)
```

This function will return the sum of the elements in the tuple `el`. If an element has a larger sum, it will have a higher priority when adding it to a cap set.
