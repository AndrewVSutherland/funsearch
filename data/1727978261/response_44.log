Sure, I'd be happy to help you improve your `priority_v1` function. Since you didn't provide a specific goal or criteria for the improvement, I'll assume that we want to prioritize tuples with more 2s and fewer 0s. Here's a simple way to do it:

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
    # Count the number of 2s and 0s in the tuple
    count_2 = el.count(2)
    count_0 = el.count(0)

    # Prioritize tuples with more 2s and fewer 0s
    return count_2 - count_0
```

This function will return a positive number if there are more 2s than 0s in the tuple, a negative number if there are more 0s than 2s, and 0 if they are equal.
