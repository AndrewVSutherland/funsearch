Sure, I'd be happy to help you improve your `priority_v1` function. However, I need more context to provide a meaningful solution.

Your current function definition is:

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
```

The function takes a tuple `el` of length `n` with values 0-2, and it should return a float which represents the priority with which we want to add `el` to the cap set.

Currently, the function doesn't have any implementation. If you could provide more details about the criteria for calculating the priority, or if there are any specific improvements you're looking for, I'd be able to assist more accurately.

For example, if the priority is calculated based on the sum of elements in the tuple, the function could be implemented as:

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  return sum(el)
```

This would mean that tuples with larger sums have higher priority. However, this is just a guess based on common practices. The actual implementation could vary greatly depending on the specific requirements of your task.
