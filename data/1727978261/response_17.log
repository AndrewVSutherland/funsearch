Sure, I'd be happy to help with that. The function `priority_v1` is supposed to improve upon `priority_v0` by assigning a priority score to a tuple `el` of length `n` with values 0-2. This priority score will determine the order in which elements are added to a cap set.

Here's a simple way to improve `priority_v0`:

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  # We could give higher priority to tuples with more 2s, assuming that 2 is more desirable than 1 or 0.
  return el.count(2)
```

This function counts the number of 2s in the tuple `el` and returns that count as the priority. Elements with more 2s will have a higher priority and be added to the cap set earlier.
