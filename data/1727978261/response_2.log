Here is an improved version of `priority_v0` that prioritizes elements with more 2's and fewer 0's. It's a simple heuristic that favors elements that contribute more to the sum of the cap set.

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`.

  This version prioritizes elements with more 2's and fewer 0's.
  """
  return el.count(2) - el.count(0)
```

This version of the function will give a positive score for elements that have more 2's than 0's, and a negative score for elements that have more 0's than 2's. Elements with an equal number of 2's and 0's will get a score of 0.

This is a very basic improvement over the original function, and it's likely that a more sophisticated priority function could be developed with further analysis of the problem. However, this simple function should already provide some improvement over the original version.
