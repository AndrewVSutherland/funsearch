Here's an improved version of `priority_v0` that considers the total number of elements in the tuple and the number of 2s in the tuple. The priority is higher for tuples with more 2s and fewer total elements. This might be a reasonable approach if we're interested in finding large cap sets with fewer missing elements.

```python
def priority_v1(el: tuple[int, ...], n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`.
  el is a tuple of length n with values 0-2.
  """
  # Count the number of 2s in the tuple
  num_twos = el.count(2)

  # Count the number of non-zero elements in the tuple
  num_non_zero = sum(1 for i in el if i != 0)

  # The priority is the number of 2s divided by the number of non-zero elements
  # If there are no non-zero elements, the priority is 0 to avoid division by zero
  return num_twos / num_non_zero if num_non_zero else 0.0
```

This is a simple priority function that might work well for this specific problem, but it's always a good idea to experiment with different priority functions to see which one works best for your specific use case.
