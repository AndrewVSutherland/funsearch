Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]` and the number of distinct values in that range. This version is shorter and makes small changes to `priority_v0`.

```python
from collections import Counter

@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
    freq = Counter(range(1, n + 1)).get(k, 0)  # Frequency of k in [1, n]
    distinct = len(set(range(1, n + 1)))  # Number of distinct values in [1, n]
    return freq / distinct  # Return the frequency divided by the number of distinct values
```

This version assumes that elements with higher frequency and fewer distinct values in the range should have higher priority. You can adjust the formula according to your specific use case.
