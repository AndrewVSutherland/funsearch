Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[0, n)` and the number of elements already in the Salem-Spencer set. This version uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequencies.

```python
from collections import Counter

@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int, ss_set: set) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`. ss_set is the current Salem-Spencer set."""
    freq = sum(1 for i in range(n) if (i * i) % n == k)
    return freq / (n * len(ss_set) + 1)
```

This version of `priority_v1` makes a small change by considering the frequency of `k` and the size of the current Salem-Spencer set. The priority is now a ratio of the frequency to the total number of possible integers and the size of the set plus one (to avoid division by zero).
