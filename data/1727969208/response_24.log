Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that uses the concept of entropy to measure the uncertainty or randomness of the distribution of elements. This version considers not only the frequency of the element but also the frequency of other elements, giving more priority to elements that are less frequent and more unique.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import entropy

def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0` using entropy."""
    # Calculate the frequency distribution of elements
    freq_dist = np.bincount(np.arange(n), minlength=n) / n
    # Calculate the entropy of the frequency distribution
    entropy_val = entropy(freq_dist, base=2)
    # Calculate the priority as the product of the frequency and the entropy
    return freq_dist[k] * entropy_val
```

This version of `priority_v1` should provide a better measure of the priority for adding an element to the Salem-Spencer set, as it considers the uniqueness and randomness of the element's distribution. The code is also short and follows the given instructions to make only small changes from the previous version.
