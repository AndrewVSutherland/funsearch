Here's an improved version of `priority_v2` that reduces the computation by using a single pass to count the frequency and unique elements:

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v1`."""
    freq = unique_elements = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i == k:
            freq += 1
        unique_elements += 1
    return freq / unique_elements
```

To further improve the function and make it shorter, we can use a generator expression to count the frequency and unique elements in a single line:

```python
def priority_v3(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v2`."""
    return sum(1 for i in range(1, n + 1) if i == k) / (n + 1)
```

This version of the function has the same time complexity as the previous ones but is shorter and more concise.
