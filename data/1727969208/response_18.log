Here's an improved version of `priority_v2` with small changes to make it more efficient and concise. I've also added a docstring to explain the purpose of the function.

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Returns the priority with which we want to add `k` to the Salem-Spencer set of size `n`.

    The priority is based on the number of unique remainders when adding `k` to each integer in the range `[0, n)`,
    and the number of remainders that are not already in the set. A higher priority value indicates a more desirable element.

    Args:
        k (int): The integer for which we want to determine the priority.
        n (int): The size of the Salem-Spencer set.

    Returns:
        float: The priority value for adding `k` to the set.
    """
    remainders = set((k + i) % n for i in range(n))
    return len(remainders) / n + 0.01 * (n - len(remainders))
```

To further improve the function, we can use a generator expression instead of a set comprehension to save memory when `n` is large. Here's the updated version:

```python
def priority_v3(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Returns the priority with which we want to add `k` to the Salem-Spencer set of size `n`.

    The priority is based on the number of unique remainders when adding `k` to each integer in the range `[0, n)`,
    and the number of remainders that are not already in the set. A higher priority value indicates a more desirable element.

    Args:
        k (int): The integer for which we want to determine the priority.
        n (int): The size of the Salem-Spencer set.

    Returns:
        float: The priority value for adding `k` to the set.
    """
    remainders = (k + i) % n for i in range(n)
    return sum(1 for _ in itertools.groupby(remainders)) / n + 0.01 * (n - sum(1 for _ in itertools.groupby(remainders)))
```

This version uses `itertools.groupby` to count the number of unique remainders, which is more efficient than converting the remainders to a set.
