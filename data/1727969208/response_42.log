Here's a small improvement to `priority_v1` by incorporating a simple adjustment based on the ratio of `k` to `n`. This change aims to make the priority function more sensitive to larger values of `k` relative to `n`.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  ratio = k / (n + 1)
  return n * ratio - k * (1 - ratio)
```

This updated function maintains the same complexity as the original while introducing a slight adjustment to better handle large `k` values relative to `n`. The change is small, as requested, and the function remains short and readable.
