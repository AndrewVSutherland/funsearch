Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that maintains the spirit of making small changes and keeping the code short. I've added a small adjustment to the formula to make it more sensitive to larger values of `k`.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  return n * (k / (n + 1)) - k + (k ** 2) / (n * (n + 1))
```

This version introduces a small quadratic term to make the priority function more sensitive to larger values of `k`. The factor `n * (n + 1)` in the denominator ensures that the term remains relatively small for small values of `k`, preserving the overall shape of the original function.
