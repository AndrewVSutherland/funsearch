Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that builds upon `priority_v0` with small changes. I've also provided an improved version of `priority_v2` that further refines the calculation.

```python
@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0` with better efficiency and accuracy."""
  if k == 1:
    return 1.0

  freq = np.sum(np.arange(1, k + 1) == k)
  remaining = n - k

  k_harmonic = sum(1 / i for i in range(1, k + 1))

  # Improve accuracy by using harmonic number for k and remaining elements
  remaining_harmonic = sum(1 / i for i in range(1, remaining + 1))

  return freq / (k_harmonic * (k_harmonic + remaining_harmonic))
```

And here's `priority_v2`, which considers the harmonic number of the sum of `k` and remaining elements for better accuracy:

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v1`."""
  if k == 1:
    return 1.0

  freq = np.sum(np.arange(1, k + 1) == k)
  remaining = n - k

  k_harmonic = sum(1 / i for i in range(1, k + 1))
  remaining_harmonic = sum(1 / i for i in range(1, remaining + 1))
  sum_harmonic = sum(1 / i for i in range(1, k + remaining + 1))

  return freq / (k_harmonic * sum_harmonic)
```

These changes are small but should improve the accuracy and efficiency of the priority calculation.
