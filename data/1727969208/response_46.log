Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` with a small change to make it more efficient by avoiding division operations:

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v1`."""
  return n * (n - k) - k * (k + 1)
```

This version uses the fact that `n / (k + 1) - k / (n + 1)` can be rewritten as `n - k - k / (n + 1)`, which simplifies to `n - k - k * (k + 1) / (n + 1)`. Further simplification leads to `n * (n - k) - k * (k + 1)`.
