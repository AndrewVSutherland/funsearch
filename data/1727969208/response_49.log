Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` with a small change to make the code shorter and more efficient by using a simple division instead of multiplication and addition:

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v1`."""
    freq = np.count_nonzero(np.arange(1, n + 1) == k)
    return freq / (k * (n - k + 1))
```

To further improve the function, we can avoid the division by zero issue when `k` is 1 and make the function more efficient by eliminating the need for the `np.arange` and `np.count_nonzero` functions. Here's an updated version:

```python
def priority_v3(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v2`."""
    freq = min(k, n - k + 1)
    return freq / k if k != 1 else n
```

In this version, `freq` is calculated as the minimum of `k` and `n - k + 1`, which is the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]`. If `k` is 1, we return `n` to avoid division by zero.
