Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of the number `k` in the range `[1, n]` and the number of divisors it has. This version is more concise and should perform better than `priority_v0`.

```python
from math import isqrt, sqrt

@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Returns the priority with which we want to add `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.
    n is the number of possible integers, and k is the integer we want to determine priority for.
    """
    freq = sum(1 for i in range(1, n + 1) if i % k == 0)  # Frequency of k in [1, n]
    num_divisors = sum(1 for i in range(1, isqrt(k) + 1) if k % i == 0) * 2 - (isqrt(k) ** 2 == k)  # Number of divisors of k
    return freq * num_divisors / n
```

This version calculates the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]` and the number of divisors of `k`. It then returns the product of these two values divided by `n`, which should give a better indication of the priority for adding `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.
