Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` with a small change to make it shorter and more efficient by using a simple loop instead of numpy's `count_nonzero`:

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v1`."""
  freq = sum(1 for i in range(1, n + 1) if i == k)  # Frequency of k in [1, n]
  return freq / (k * (n - k + 1))
```

This version of the function does the same thing as `priority_v1` but with less code and better performance for large values of `n`.
