Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that builds upon `priority_v0` with small changes to make it more efficient and accurate. I've also added some type hints for better readability.

```python
import numpy as np

def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0` with better efficiency and accuracy."""
  if k == 1:
    return 1.0  # Base case: priority is always 1 for the first element

  freq = np.sum(np.arange(1, k + 1) == k)  # Frequency of k in [1, k]
  remaining = n - k  # Number of remaining elements

  # Improve accuracy by using harmonic number for k instead of k itself
  k_harmonic = sum(1 / i for i in range(1, k + 1))

  return freq / (k_harmonic * (k_harmonic + remaining))
```

Changes made:

1. Added a base case for `k == 1` to avoid division by zero and improve efficiency.
2. Changed the range of the frequency calculation to `[1, k]` instead of `[1, n]`, as the frequency of `k` in `[k+1, n]` is always 0.
3. Replaced `k` with the harmonic number of `k` in the denominator to improve accuracy, as the harmonic number better represents the "size" of `k` in terms of its contribution to the Salem-Spencer set.
