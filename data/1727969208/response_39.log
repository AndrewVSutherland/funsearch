Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that builds upon `priority_v0` with a small change to further improve efficiency by avoiding the calculation of the harmonic number for each `k`. Instead, it uses the fact that the harmonic number `H_n` can be calculated as `H_n = gamma(n + 1)` where `gamma` is the gamma function.

```python
import math

@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
    if k == 1:
        return 1.0

    freq = np.sum(np.arange(1, k + 1) == k)
    remaining = n - k

    # Use gamma function to calculate harmonic number for k
    k_harmonic = math.gamma(k + 1)

    return freq / (k_harmonic * (k_harmonic + remaining))
```

To further improve `priority_v2`, we can use the fact that the harmonic number `H_n` can be approximated using Stirling's approximation, which is more efficient for large `n`. However, since we're dealing with small integers here, the improvement might be negligible. Nevertheless, here's the updated `priority_v2`:

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v1` using Stirling's approximation for harmonic number."""
    if k == 1:
        return 1.0

    freq = np.sum(np.arange(1, k + 1) == k)
    remaining = n - k

    # Use Stirling's approximation for harmonic number for k
    k_harmonic = np.sqrt(2 * np.pi * k) * (k / math.e) ** k

    return freq / (k_harmonic * (k_harmonic + remaining))
```
