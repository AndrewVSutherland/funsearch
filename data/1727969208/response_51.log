Here's an improved version of `priority_v2` with a small change to make it shorter and more efficient by avoiding the multiplication of `n` with `ratio`:

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v1`."""
  ratio = k / (n + 1)
  return n * (ratio - 1) + k * ratio
```

This version reduces the number of operations and makes the code more concise.
