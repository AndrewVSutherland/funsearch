Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the number of unique remainders when dividing `k` by `n`, which is a simple heuristic for estimating the diversity of the Salem-Spencer set. I've also added some type hints and docstring improvements.

```python
from typing import Iterator

def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """
    Returns the priority with which we want to add `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.

    n is the number of possible integers, and k is the integer we want to determine priority for.

    This version considers the number of unique remainders when dividing `k` by `n`, as a simple heuristic
    for estimating the diversity of the Salem-Spencer set.
    """
    remainders = set(k % i for i in range(1, n + 1))
    return len(remainders) / n
```

To further improve this function, you could consider the following aspects:

1. **Iterative improvement**: As per your instructions, make small changes iteratively. You could consider the number of times each remainder appears, not just the count of unique remainders.

2. **Combinatorial aspects**: Consider the combination of remainders that `k` can produce when divided by all possible divisors up to `n`. This could give a better estimate of the diversity of the Salem-Spencer set.

3. **Primes and composite numbers**: Different strategies could be applied depending on whether `k` is a prime or a composite number. For example, prime numbers could be given a higher priority as they are more likely to produce unique remainders.

Here's an example of how you could incorporate the first improvement:

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """
    An improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of remainders as well.
    """
    remainders = {k % i: remainders.count(k % i) for i in range(1, n + 1)}
    return sum(v / n for v in remainders.values())
```
