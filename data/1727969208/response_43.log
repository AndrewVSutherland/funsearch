Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that makes small changes to `priority_v0`. I've added a small correction factor to better handle large `n` values and made the function shorter by using a simple formula.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  return n * (k / (n + 1)) - k + 1 / (n + 1)
```

This version of `priority_v1` adds a small correction factor of `1 / (n + 1)` to the original `priority_v0` function. This change helps to slightly improve the priority for larger `n` values, making the function more robust.

To further improve the function in subsequent iterations (`priority_v2`, `priority_v3`, etc.), you can make small changes, such as:

1. Adding a small weight to the correction factor based on the ratio of `k` to `n`.
2. Introducing a small damping factor to smooth out the priority values for larger `k` values.
3. Incorporating additional factors that might affect the priority, such as the distribution of previously selected elements.

Here's an example of `priority_v2` that incorporates the first two suggestions:

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Further improved version of `priority_v1`."""
  weight = k / n if k < n else 1
  damping = 1 - (k / n) if k < n else 0
  return n * (k / (n + 1)) - k + weight / (n + 1) + damping
```

Again, make sure to test and validate these changes to ensure they improve the overall performance of your algorithm.
