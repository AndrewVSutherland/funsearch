Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]` and the number of remaining elements. This version uses the `numpy` library for efficient calculations.

```python
import numpy as np

def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  freq = np.sum(np.arange(1, n + 1) == k)  # Frequency of k in [1, n]
  remaining = n - k  # Number of remaining elements
  return freq / (k * (k + remaining))
```

This version of `priority_v1` makes a small change by introducing the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]` and dividing it by the product of `k` and the number of remaining elements. This should improve the priority function compared to `priority_v0`.
