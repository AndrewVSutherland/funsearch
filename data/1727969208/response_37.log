Here's an improved version of `priority_v2` that reduces the number of operations and uses generator expressions for better performance:

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v1`."""
    return sum(1 for i in range(1, n + 1) if i == k) / n
```

In this version, we use a generator expression to count the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]`, and then divide it by `n` to get the priority. This version is more concise and should perform better than the previous ones.
