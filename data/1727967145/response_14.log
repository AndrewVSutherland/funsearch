Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[0, n)` and the number of its multiples within that range. This version is shorter and makes a small change from `priority_v0`.

```python
from collections import Counter

@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Returns the priority with which we want to add `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.
    n is the number of possible integers, and k is the integer we want to determine priority for.
    """
    multiples = [i for i in range(n) if i % k == 0]
    freq = Counter(multiples)
    return len(multiples) * freq[k] / n
```

This version calculates the frequency of `k` and its multiples in the range `[0, n)` and returns the priority as the product of the number of multiples and the frequency of `k`, divided by `n`. This should provide a better estimate of the priority for adding `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.
