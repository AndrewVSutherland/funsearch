Here's an improved version of `priority_v2` with small changes to make the code shorter and more efficient. I've used numpy for faster computations and removed the unnecessary range for multiples.

```python
import numpy as np

def priority_v3(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v2`."""
    remainders = np.unique((k * np.arange(1, n + 1)) % n)
    return len(remainders) / n + np.count_nonzero((k * np.arange(1, n + 1)) % n == 0) / n
```

Changes made:

1. Used `np.arange(1, n + 1)` to generate the range of numbers from 1 to `n` in a more concise way.
2. Used `np.unique` to find unique remainders, which is faster than converting the set to a list and then finding the length.
3. Used `np.count_nonzero` to count the number of multiples, which is more efficient than using a `for` loop.
4. Removed the unnecessary comments.
