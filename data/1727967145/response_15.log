Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]` and the distance from `k` to the nearest power of 2. This version is more concise and makes small changes to improve the priority calculation.

```python
import math

def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Returns the priority with which we want to add `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.
  n is the number of possible integers, and k is the integer we want to determine priority for.
  """
  freq = sum(1 for i in range(1, n + 1) if i % k == 0)  # Frequency of k in [1, n]
  dist = min(abs(math.log2(k)) - math.floor(math.log2(k)), math.log2(n) - math.ceil(math.log2(k)))  # Distance to nearest power of 2
  return freq / (dist + 1)  # Add a small constant to avoid division by zero
```

This version of `priority_v1` considers both the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]` and its distance to the nearest power of 2. The priority is calculated as the frequency divided by the distance plus a small constant to avoid division by zero. This should provide a better estimate of the priority for adding `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.
