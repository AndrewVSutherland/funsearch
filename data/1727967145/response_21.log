Here's an improved version of `priority_v2` with some small changes to make the code shorter and more efficient:

```python
def priority_v3(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v2`."""
  remainders = set((k * i) % n for i in range(1, n + 1))
  multiples = sum((k * i) % n == 0 for i in range(1, n + 1))
  return len(remainders) / n + multiples / n
```

Changes made:

1. Replaced the `sum(1 for ...)` with a generator expression `(k * i) % n == 0 for i in range(1, n + 1)` to directly calculate the sum of multiples.
2. Removed the unnecessary comments for better readability.
