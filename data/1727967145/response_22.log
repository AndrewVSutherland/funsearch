Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the number of occurrences of `k` in the Salem-Spencer set and the number of possible integers `n`. I've made small changes to keep the code short and efficient.

```python
@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Returns the priority with which we want to add `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.
  n is the number of possible integers, and k is the integer we want to determine priority for.
  """
  # Count the occurrences of k in the Salem-Spencer set
  count = sum(1 for i in range(1, n + 1) if (i * i - 1) % (2 * k) == 0)

  # Priority is based on the count and the number of possible integers
  return count / n
```

This version of `priority_v1` calculates the priority by dividing the count of occurrences of `k` in the Salem-Spencer set by the total number of possible integers `n`. This should provide a better estimate of the priority for adding `k` to the set compared to `priority_v0`.
