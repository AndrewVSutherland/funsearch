Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]` and its distance from the middle of the range. This version is shorter and makes small changes to `priority_v0`.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  freq = sum(1 for i in range(1, n + 1) if i % k == 0)  # Frequency of k in [1, n]
  mid = n // 2 + 1  # Middle of the range [1, n]
  return freq / (mid - abs(k - mid))  # Prioritize closer to the middle and higher frequency
```

This version uses the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]` and its distance from the middle of the range to determine the priority. The priority is calculated as the frequency divided by the distance from the middle, prioritizing numbers closer to the middle and with higher frequency.
