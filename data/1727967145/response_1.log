Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]` and the number of elements in the range that are multiples of `k`. This version is shorter and makes small changes to `priority_v0`.

```python
from collections import Counter

@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    freq = Counter(range(1, n + 1)).get(k, 0)
    multiples = sum(1 for i in range(1, n + 1) if i % k == 0)
    return freq / (multiples + 1)
```

This version of `priority_v1` calculates the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]` and the number of multiples of `k` in the same range. It then returns the frequency divided by the number of multiples plus one (to avoid division by zero). This should provide a better measure of the priority for adding `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.
