Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]` and the number of divisors `k` has. This version is shorter and makes small changes to `priority_v0`.

```python
from math import isqrt

def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`. Considers frequency of `k` and number of divisors."""
  freq = sum(1 for _ in range(1, n + 1) if _ % k == 0)  # Frequency of k in [1, n]
  num_divisors = sum(1 for i in range(1, isqrt(k) + 1) if k % i == 0) * 2 - (isqrt(k) ** 2 == k)  # Number of divisors of k
  return freq / n + num_divisors / k
```

This version of `priority_v1` calculates the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]` and the number of divisors `k` has. It then returns a weighted sum of these two values, giving more priority to numbers that appear more frequently and have more divisors.
