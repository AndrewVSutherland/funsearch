Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]` and the number of unique elements in that range. This version also uses the `itertools` library to generate the range efficiently.

```python
from collections import Counter

import itertools

def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
    # Generate the range [1, n] efficiently using itertools
    range_n = list(itertools.islice(itertools.count(1), n))

    # Count the frequency of k in the range
    freq_k = range_n.count(k)

    # Count the number of unique elements in the range
    unique_elements = len(set(range_n))

    # Calculate the priority as the frequency of k divided by the number of unique elements
    priority = freq_k / unique_elements

    return priority
```

This version of `priority_v1` makes a small change from `priority_v0` by actually calculating a meaningful priority value based on the frequency of `k` and the number of unique elements in the range. It also uses more efficient methods to generate the range and count the frequency of `k`.
