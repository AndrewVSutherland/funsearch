Here's an improved version of `priority_v2` that reduces the number of iterations and uses numpy for efficient calculations:

```python
import numpy as np

@funsearch.run
def priority_v3(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v2`."""
    remainders = np.unique((k * np.arange(1, n + 1)) % n)
    multiples = np.count_nonzero((k * np.arange(1, n + 1)) % n == 0)
    return len(remainders) / n + multiples / n
```

Changes made:

1. Used numpy's `arange` to generate the range of numbers from 1 to `n` in one line.
2. Used numpy's `unique` to find unique remainders in one line.
3. Used numpy's `count_nonzero` to count multiples in one line.
4. Removed unnecessary comments and improved the docstring.
