The `priority_v1` function is not defined in the given code. To improve the `priority_v0` function, we can consider the following modifications:

1. Instead of returning 0.0 for integers that are not relatively prime to `n`, we can return a smaller priority value. This way, even non-relatively prime integers can have a chance of being added to the Salem-Spencer set.
2. We can add a small penalty for larger values of `k` to encourage the selection of smaller integers.

Here is an improved version of the `priority_v0` function:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
    gcd = np.gcd(k, n)

    # If k and n are relatively prime, the priority is inversely proportional to k with a small penalty
    if gcd == 1:
        return 1.0 / (k + 1) if k != 0 else float('inf')

    # If k and n are not relatively prime, return a smaller priority value
    else:
        return 0.1 / (k + 1)
```

In this version, the priority is calculated as the inverse of `k + 1` for both relatively prime and non-relatively prime integers, with a small penalty for larger values of `k`. For non-relatively prime integers, the priority is divided by 10 to ensure that relatively prime integers have a higher priority.
