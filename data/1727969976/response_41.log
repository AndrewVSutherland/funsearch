Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that takes into account the number of common divisors between `k` and `n`:

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v1`."""
  # Calculate the greatest common divisor of k and n
  gcd = np.gcd(k, n)

  # Count the number of common divisors between k and n
  common_divisors = sum(1 for i in range(1, gcd + 1) if k % i == n % i == 0)

  # If k and n are relatively prime, the priority is inversely proportional to k
  # but we penalize larger k values to prioritize smaller ones.
  if gcd == 1:
    return 1.0 / (k + 1) if k != 0 else float('inf')

  # If k and n are not relatively prime, the priority is lower than k is relatively prime
  # but we also consider the value of gcd and the number of common divisors to provide a preference.
  else:
    return 0.1 / (gcd * common_divisors)
```

In this version, if `k` and `n` are not relatively prime, the priority is not only inversely proportional to the greatest common divisor (`gcd`), but also inversely proportional to the number of common divisors between `k` and `n`. This allows us to prioritize numbers with fewer common divisors, assuming that these numbers are more likely to contribute to a large Salem-Spencer progression.

This version of the `priority` function may be more computationally expensive than the previous versions, due to the additional calculation of `common_divisors`. However, the improvement in the quality of the search may justify this additional cost.
