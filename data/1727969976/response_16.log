The next iteration of the `priority_v1` function could be improved by considering the frequency of numbers in the range 0 to n that are divisible by k. If k is a large factor of n, it means that many numbers in the range will be divisible by k and thus not prime candidates, so it should be given a lower priority.

Here's how this could be incorporated into the function:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`.
  The priority is calculated based on the modulo of `k` with `n` and the frequency of numbers divisible by `k`.
  """
  # Calculate the greatest common divisor of k and n
  gcd = np.gcd(k, n)

  # Calculate the frequency of numbers divisible by k in the range 0 to n
  frequency = n // k

  # If k and n are relatively prime, and k is not a large factor of n, the priority is inversely proportional to k
  if gcd == 1 and frequency <= n // 10:
    return 1.0 / k if k != 0 else float('inf')

  # If k and n are not relatively prime, or k is a large factor of n, the priority is lower
  else:
    return 0.0
```

In this version of the function, if k is a large factor of n (i.e., if `frequency > n // 10`), it gets a lower priority. This prevents the function from overly prioritizing divisors of n that are not relatively prime to n.
