When improving the priority function, we might want to consider how far `k` is from the elements already in the Salem-Spencer set. The further `k` is from these elements, the higher its priority should be. Here's a simple way to implement this:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, ss_set: set, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0` using the average distance from `k` to the elements in `ss_set`."""
  if not ss_set:
    return float('inf')  # If the set is empty, `k` has the highest priority.
  else:
    return n - np.mean([abs(k - ss) for ss in ss_set])  # The higher the average distance, the higher the priority.
```

In this version of the function, `ss_set` is the current Salem-Spencer set. The priority of `k` is inversely proportional to the average distance from `k` to the elements in `ss_set`. This means that the further `k` is from the elements in `ss_set`, the higher its priority.
