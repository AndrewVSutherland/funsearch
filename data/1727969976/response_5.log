It seems like you're trying to improve a function that calculates the priority of adding an integer to a Salem-Spencer set. The function `priority_v0` takes two arguments: `k`, which is the integer we want to determine priority for, and `n`, which is the number of possible integers. The function `priority_v1` is an improved version of `priority_v0` that you're trying to write.

However, the code for `priority_v1` is not provided. I'll help you write this function based on the description and the existing code.

Given that you're looking for large SS progressions, a reasonable approach could be to prioritize integers that have a high probability of being part of a large progression. One way to do this could be to prioritize integers that have more potential divisors, as they could potentially form a longer progression.

Here's a simple implementation of `priority_v1` that prioritizes integers based on the number of their divisors:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    # Function to count the number of divisors of a given number
    def count_divisors(num):
        count = 0
        for i in range(1, num + 1):
            if num % i == 0:
                count += 1
        return count

    # Prioritize based on the number of divisors
    return count_divisors(k) / n
```

This function counts the number of divisors for the integer `k` and normalizes it by dividing it by `n`. The result is a number between 0 and 1, where 1 means that `k` has the maximum possible number of divisors for an integer up to `n`.
