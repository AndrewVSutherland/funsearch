Here's an improved version of `priority_v0` that calculates the priority based on the modulo of `k` with `n`. This might be a simple way to find large Salem-Spencer progressions, as it prioritizes integers that are relatively prime to `n` and smaller in value.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`.
  The priority is calculated based on the modulo of `k` with `n`.
  Integers that are relatively prime to `n` and smaller in value get higher priority.
  """
  # Calculate the greatest common divisor of k and n
  gcd = np.gcd(k, n)

  # If k and n are relatively prime, the priority is inversely proportional to k
  # This prioritizes smaller integers over larger ones
  if gcd == 1:
    return 1.0 / k if k != 0 else float('inf')

  # If k and n are not relatively prime, the priority is lower
  else:
    return 0.0
```

This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `k` and `n`. If they are relatively prime (i.e., their GCD is 1), the function returns the inverse of `k` as the priority. This means that smaller integers get higher priority. If `k` is 0, the function returns infinity, because 0 is not invertible. If `k` and `n` are not relatively prime, the function returns 0, which is a lower priority than any positive number could have.
