Here's a possible improved version of `priority_v0` that considers the size of the gap between `k` and the largest element currently in the salem-spencer set:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, ss_set: set) -> float:
  """Returns the priority with which we want to add `k` to the salem-spencer set.
  ss_set is the current salem-spencer set, and k is the integer we want to determine priority for.
  """
  if not ss_set:  # If ss_set is empty, priority is 1.0
    return 1.0
  max_ss_set = max(ss_set)
  gap = k - max_ss_set
  return 1.0 / gap if gap > 0 else 0.0
```

In this version, if `k` is larger than the current largest element in `ss_set`, the priority is inversely proportional to the gap between `k` and that element. If `k` is not larger than the current largest element in `ss_set`, the priority is 0.0. This way, we prioritize adding larger numbers to the set, and larger gaps between numbers.
