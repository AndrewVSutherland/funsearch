The problem is about finding large Salem-Spencer progressions, which are sequences of integers with specified properties. The task is to define a function that calculates the priority with which a given integer should be added to the Salem-Spencer set. The function should take two arguments: `k`, the integer to be prioritized, and `n`, the number of possible integers. The `priority_v0` function is a placeholder that returns 0.0, and the task is to improve upon this in the `priority_v1` function.

Here's a possible solution that calculates the priority based on the number of prime factors of `k` and `n`:

```python
def count_prime_factors(num: int) -> int:
  """Returns the number of prime factors of `num`."""
  i = 2
  factors = 0
  while i * i <= num:
    if num % i:
      i += 1
    else:
      num //= i
      factors += 1
  if num > 1:
    factors += 1
  return factors

def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  # Prioritize numbers with fewer prime factors
  k_factors = count_prime_factors(k)
  n_factors = count_prime_factors(n)
  return 1.0 / (k_factors + 1) - 1.0 / (n_factors + 1)
```

In this solution, the `count_prime_factors` function calculates the number of prime factors of a given integer. The `priority_v1` function then calculates the priority of `k` based on the number of its prime factors and the number of prime factors of `n`. The priority is calculated as the difference between the reciprocals of these two values, with a small constant added to avoid division by zero. This prioritizes numbers with fewer prime factors, as these are likely to be more "sparse" and therefore more likely to be part of a large Salem-Spencer progression.
