Here is an improved version of `priority_v0` that considers the size of the number `k` and its proximity to the midpoint of the range of possible numbers.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  midpoint = n // 2
  size = np.log10(abs(k)) if k != 0 else 0
  distance_from_midpoint = abs(k - midpoint)

  # The priority is inversely proportional to the size and distance from the midpoint
  priority = 1 / (size + 1) / (distance_from_midpoint + 1)

  return priority
```

This priority function assumes that smaller numbers and numbers closer to the midpoint are more desirable. It also handles the case where `k` is zero by returning a priority of 1 (since the logarithm of zero is undefined).
