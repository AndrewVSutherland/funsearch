The `priority_v1` function hasn't been implemented yet. Let's assume we want to calculate the priority based on the frequency of the number in a given dataset. We can use a histogram to get the frequency of each number and use it to calculate the priority. Here's a simple implementation:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, data: np.ndarray) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  n = len(data)
  frequency = np.count_nonzero(data == k)
  return frequency / n
```

In this function, `data` is the dataset we have and `n` is the total number of elements in the dataset. The function calculates the frequency of `k` in the dataset and returns it as the priority.
