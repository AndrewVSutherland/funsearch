It seems that there's a mistake in the code provided. The `priority_v1` function is not defined. Here's an improved version of `priority_v0` that could be used as a starting point for `priority_v1`:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`.

  This version returns the priority based on the square of the ratio of the integer to be considered
  to the total number of possible integers. The square of the ratio amplifies the difference between
  smaller and larger integers, which might be useful in a Salem-Spencer progression context.
  """
  return (k / n) ** 2
```

In this version, the priority is calculated as the square of the ratio of the integer `k` to the total number of possible integers `n`. This modification might be more suitable for a Salem-Spencer progression context, as it amplifies the difference between smaller and larger integers.
