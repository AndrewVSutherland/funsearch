It seems like you're working on a function called `priority_v1` which is intended to be an improvement over a previous function `priority_v0`.

However, the provided code for `priority_v1` is incomplete. It's currently just a declaration of the function with a comment about its purpose.

Given that the function is supposed to return a priority value based on the inputs `k` and `n`, I can help with writing a basic version of the function. However, improving it over `priority_v0` would require knowing more about the specific problem you're trying to solve and the context in which `priority_v0` is used.

Here's a simple implementation of `priority_v1` assuming a linear relationship between `k` and `n`:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`. This implementation assumes a linear relationship between `k` and `n`."""
  return k / n if n != 0 else 0.0
```

In this version, the priority is calculated as the ratio of `k` to `n`, unless `n` is zero (to avoid division by zero errors). This is a very basic implementation and may not be suitable for your specific use case.
