It seems like the `priority_v1` function is not completed. Here's an improved version of `priority_v0` to `priority_v1`. This version might take into account the distribution of integers in the set, assuming that smaller numbers are more likely to be included in a large progression.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int, data: list) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  # Calculate frequency of numbers in the data
  freq = {i: data.count(i) for i in set(data)}

  # If k is not in the data, it has a lower priority
  if k not in freq:
    return k / n

  # Otherwise, its priority is inversely proportional to its frequency
  else:
    return k / n / freq[k]
```

In this version, `data` is a list of integers that have already been added to the Salem-Spencer set. The function calculates the frequency of each integer in the data, and then it adjusts the priority of `k` based on this frequency. If `k` is not in the data, its priority is the same as in `priority_v0`. If `k` is in the data, its priority is reduced in proportion to its frequency, so that less common numbers are more likely to be added to the set.
