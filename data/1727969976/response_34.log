Sure, here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that also takes into account the frequency of the integer `k` in the range `[1, n]`. The more frequent an integer is, the lower its priority:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`.

  This version not only considers the ratio of the integer to be considered to the total number
  of possible integers, but also takes into account the frequency of the integer in the range.
  The priority is calculated as the ratio of the integer to the total number of possible integers,
  divided by the frequency of the integer in the range.
  """
  frequency = np.bincount(np.arange(1, n + 1))[k]
  return k / n / frequency
```

This version of the function should provide a more balanced priority distribution, as it not only considers the size of the integer but also its frequency in the range.
