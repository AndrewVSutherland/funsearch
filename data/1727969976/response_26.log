The problem is about finding large progressions in Salem-Spencer sets. The Salem-Spencer set is a subset of the integers, and we are trying to find elements to add to it. The priority of adding an element is determined by the function `priority_vX`, where X represents the version of the function. In each version, we try to improve the priority function over the previous one, making only small changes and trying to keep the code short.

Here's an improved version of the `priority_v1` function that uses the concept of gaps between numbers in the Salem-Spencer set to determine priority:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, ss_set: set) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  max_gap = 0
  ss_list = sorted(list(ss_set))
  for i in range(1, len(ss_list)):
    gap = ss_list[i] - ss_list[i-1] - 1
    max_gap = max(max_gap, gap)
  return max_gap - (ss_list[-1] - k)
```

In this version, we calculate the maximum gap between any two consecutive numbers in the Salem-Spencer set and subtract the gap between the last element in the set and the candidate element `k`. This gives us a priority score that favors adding elements that can fill large gaps in the set.
