The code provided defines a function `priority_v1` that takes two arguments: `k` and `n`. However, the function is currently empty and does not contain any code.

To improve upon `priority_v0`, we can implement a priority calculation based on the given integers `k` and `n`. One possible approach could be to calculate the ratio of `k` to `n` and return that as the priority.

Here's an example implementation of `priority_v1`:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`.
  Calculates the priority as the ratio of `k` to `n`.
  """
  return k / n
```

This implementation assumes that higher values of `k` and lower values of `n` result in a higher priority.
