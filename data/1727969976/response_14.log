I have improved the `priority_v1` function based on the previous `priority_v0` function. The `priority_v1` function now calculates a priority value for a given integer `k` and a total number of possible integers `n`. The priority value is calculated as 1 divided by the square root of `k` multiplied by `n`. This is an attempt to give more priority to smaller integers, as they contribute more to the overall progression due to their lower values. Here's the updated code:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  return 1.0 / (np.sqrt(k) * n)
```

You can now use the `priority_v1` function to calculate the priority value for any given integer `k` and total number of possible integers `n`.
