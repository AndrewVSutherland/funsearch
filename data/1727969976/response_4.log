The problem requires improving the priority function for a Salem-Spencer set. A Salem-Spencer set is a set of integers that has no non-trivial arithmetic progression. The priority function assigns a value to each integer, indicating its likelihood of being added to the set.

The original priority function `priority_v0` returns 0.0 for all integers. This is not useful because it doesn't differentiate between the integers.

The improved version `priority_v1` should return a value that varies depending on the input integer `k` and the total number of possible integers `n`. One possible way to improve the function is to return a value that is inversely proportional to `k`. This way, smaller integers will have a higher priority.

Here is a possible implementation of `priority_v1`:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`.
  Returns a value that is inversely proportional to `k`.
  """
  return 1.0 / k
```

This function will return a value between 0 and 1 for each integer `k`, with smaller `k` having a higher priority. Note that this function assumes that `k` is always greater than 0. If `k` could be 0, the function should be modified to handle this case.

The function also assumes that `n` is constant and not used in the calculation of the priority. If `n` is relevant to the calculation of the priority, the function should be modified to take this into account.

Finally, note that the choice of priority function can have a significant impact on the results. Different priority functions will lead to different Salem-Spencer sets. The function `priority_v1` is just one possible improvement over `priority_v0`, and there may be other ways to improve the function that are not considered here.
