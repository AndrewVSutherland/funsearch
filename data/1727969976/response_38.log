To improve the `priority_v1` function, let's consider the following changes:

1. Instead of using a constant value of 0.1 for the priority when k and n are not relatively prime, let's use a value that is proportional to the square root of the gcd. This will give more weight to numbers with larger gcd.
2. Let's add a small penalty to larger values of k when k and n are not relatively prime, to prioritize smaller numbers even in this case.
3. Let's handle the case when k is zero separately, as it causes a division by zero error in the current implementation. We can assign a high priority to zero when k is not equal to n, and a low priority when k is equal to n.

Here's the improved version of `priority_v2`:

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v1`."""
    # Calculate the greatest common divisor of k and n
    gcd = np.gcd(k, n)

    # If k and n are relatively prime, the priority is inversely proportional to k
    # but we penalize larger k values to prioritize smaller ones.
    if gcd == 1:
        return 1.0 / (k + 1) if k != 0 else float('inf')

    # If k and n are not relatively prime, the priority is lower than k is relatively prime
    # but we also consider the value of gcd to provide a small preference to numbers with larger gcd.
    else:
        return 0.1 / (np.sqrt(gcd) * (k + 1))

    # If k is zero, assign a high priority if k is not equal to n, and a low priority if k is equal to n.
    if k == 0:
        return float('inf') if k != n else 0.0
```

This version of the function takes into account the magnitude of the gcd and the value of k when deciding the priority, providing a more nuanced decision-making process.
