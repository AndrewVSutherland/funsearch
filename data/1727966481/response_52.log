Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the number of unique remainders when dividing `k` by `n`. This is inspired by the Salem-Spencer problem, where the priority is often determined by the number of distinct remainders. I've also added a small improvement to `priority_v0` for comparison.

```python
@funsearch.run
def priority_v0(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Returns the priority with which we want to add `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.
    n is the number of possible integers, and k is the integer we want to determine priority for.
    """
    return 1.0 / (k + 1)  # Small improvement: prioritize smaller k

def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
    remainders = set(k % i for i in range(1, n + 1))
    return len(remainders) / n  # Prioritize based on the number of unique remainders

# Test the functions
n = 10
ks = list(range(1, n + 1))
print({k: priority_v0(k, n) for k in ks})
print({k: priority_v1(k, n) for k in ks})
```

In this version, `priority_v1` calculates the number of unique remainders when dividing `k` by each integer from 1 to `n`. It then returns the ratio of unique remainders to `n`, which should give a higher priority to integers with more unique remainders. This is a small change that builds upon the previous version while keeping the code short.
