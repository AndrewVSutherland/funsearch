Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that uses the concept of "missing integers" in the Salem-Spencer set. This version considers the number of integers less than `k` that are not in the set, which gives a higher priority to integers with more missing integers below them.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0` using missing integers concept."""
  return n - np.sum(np.arange(1, k) in funsearch.state)
```

This version assumes that `funsearch.state` is a set containing the current Salem-Spencer set. The `np.arange(1, k)` generates a sequence of integers from 1 to `k - 1`, and `np.sum(np.arange(1, k) in funsearch.state)` counts how many of these integers are already in the set. Subtracting this count from `n` gives the number of missing integers less than `k`, which is used as the priority.

To make the code even shorter, you can use a generator expression instead of `np.arange()`:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0` using missing integers concept."""
  return n - sum(i in funsearch.state for i in range(1, k))
```

Both versions make small changes to improve the priority function while keeping the code concise.
