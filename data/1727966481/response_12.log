Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]` and the number of elements in the Salem-Spencer set. This version uses the `itertools` library to generate the range and `np.sum` to calculate the frequency of `k`.

```python
from typing import Dict, List

@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int, ss_set: Dict[int, int] = None) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0` that considers the frequency of `k` and the size of the SS set."""
    if ss_set is None:
        ss_set = {}

    freq_k = sum(1 for _ in filter(lambda x: x == k, range(1, n + 1)))
    return freq_k / (n + 1) + len(ss_set) ** -0.5
```

This version also accepts an optional `ss_set` parameter, which is a dictionary representing the current Salem-Spencer set. If `ss_set` is not provided, it defaults to an empty dictionary. The priority is now calculated as the sum of the frequency of `k` and the reciprocal of the square root of the size of the Salem-Spencer set. This encourages adding elements that are frequent and have not been added yet.
