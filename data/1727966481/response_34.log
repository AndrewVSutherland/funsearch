Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[0, n)` and its distance from the middle of the range. This version uses numpy's `bincount` function to count the occurrences of `k` and calculates the priority based on these counts and the distance from the middle.

```python
import numpy as np

def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
    # Count the occurrences of k in the range [0, n)
    counts = np.bincount(np.arange(n), minlength=n)
    k_count = counts[k]

    # Calculate the priority based on the count and the distance from the middle
    middle = n // 2
    distance = abs(k - middle)
    priority = k_count / (distance + 1)

    return priority
```

This version of `priority_v1` makes small changes to the original `priority_v0` by adding functionality to count the occurrences of `k` and incorporating the distance from the middle into the priority calculation. The code is still relatively short and follows the given instructions.
