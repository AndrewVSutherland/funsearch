Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the number of unique remainders when dividing `k` by `n`, as well as the number of multiples of `k` within `n`. This version is shorter and makes small changes to improve the priority function.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  remainders = set((k % i) for i in range(1, n + 1))
  multiples = k * (n // k)
  return len(remainders) + multiples
```

This version uses a set to count the unique remainders, which is more efficient than using a list or other data structures. It also calculates the number of multiples of `k` within `n` using integer division (`//`) and multiplication. The priority is then the sum of unique remainders and multiples.

To further improve the function, you can consider other factors that might affect the priority, such as the distribution of remainders or the proximity of `k` to perfect squares. However, keep in mind that making the function too complex might make it harder to understand and maintain.

Here's an example of how you can use this function with the `funsearch` decorator:

```python
@funsearch.run
def find_large_ss_progression(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  priority = priority_v1(k, n)
  print(f"Priority for k={k} and n={n}: {priority}")
  return priority
```

You can then run this function with different values of `k` and `n` to find large Salem-Spencer progressions.
