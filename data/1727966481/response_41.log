Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]` and the number of remaining integers. This version uses the `itertools` module to generate the range and `np.mean` to calculate the frequency.

```python
import numpy as np
import itertools

def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
    # Generate the range [1, n]
    range_n = list(itertools.islice(itertools.count(), n))

    # Calculate the frequency of k in the range
    freq_k = range_n.count(k)

    # Calculate the priority as the frequency of k divided by the number of remaining integers
    priority = freq_k / (n - k)

    return priority
```

This version makes a small change from `priority_v0` by considering the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]`. It also divides the frequency by the number of remaining integers to give a sense of priority based on scarcity. The code is also kept short as requested.
