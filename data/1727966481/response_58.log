Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]` and the number of unique multiples of `k` within that range. This version is shorter and makes small changes to `priority_v0`.

```python
from collections import Counter

@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Returns the priority with which we want to add `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.
    n is the number of possible integers, and k is the integer we want to determine priority for.
    """
    multiples = set(range(1, n + 1)) & set(range(k, n + 1, k))
    freq = Counter(range(1, n + 1)).get(k, 0)
    return freq * len(multiples)
```

This version calculates the frequency of `k` using `Counter` and finds the unique multiples of `k` within the range `[1, n]`. The priority is then calculated as the product of the frequency and the number of unique multiples.
