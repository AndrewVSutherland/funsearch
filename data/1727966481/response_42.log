Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]` and the number of elements in the Salem-Spencer set. This version uses the `itertools` library to generate all possible subsets of the range `[1, n]`.

```python
import itertools

def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
    # Count the frequency of k in the range [1, n]
    freq_k = sum(1 for i in range(1, n + 1) if i % k == 0)

    # Generate all possible subsets of the range [1, n]
    subsets = [set(s) for s in itertools.chain.from_iterable(itertools.combinations(range(1, n + 1), r) for r in range(1, n + 2))]

    # Calculate the number of subsets that contain k
    num_subsets_with_k = sum(1 for s in subsets if k in s)

    # Return the priority as the frequency of k divided by the number of subsets that contain k
    return freq_k / num_subsets_with_k if num_subsets_with_k > 0 else 0.0
```

This version of `priority_v1` should provide a better estimate of the priority for adding `k` to the Salem-Spencer set by considering the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]` and the number of subsets that contain `k`. The code is also relatively short and only makes small changes to the original `priority_v0` function.
