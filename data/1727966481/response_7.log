Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]` and the number of multiples of `k` within that range. This version is shorter and makes small changes to improve the priority function.

```python
from collections import Counter

@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Returns the priority with which we want to add `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.
  n is the number of possible integers, and k is the integer we want to determine priority for.
  """
  freq = Counter(range(1, n + 1)).get(k, 0)
  multiples = (n // k) - (k - 1) // k
  return freq + multiples
```

This version uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]`. It also calculates the number of multiples of `k` within that range. The priority is then the sum of the frequency and the number of multiples.
