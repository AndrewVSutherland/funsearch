Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the number of unique remainders when dividing `k` by `n` and the number of multiples of `k` within `n`. This version is shorter and makes a small change from `priority_v0`.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  return len(set(k % i for i in range(1, n + 1))) + sum(1 for i in range(1, n + 1) if i % k == 0)
```

This version calculates the priority as the sum of:

1. The number of unique remainders when dividing `k` by each integer from 1 to `n`. This encourages adding `k` to the Salem-Spencer set if it has many unique remainders, as this can lead to a larger set.
2. The number of multiples of `k` within the range from 1 to `n`. This encourages adding `k` if it has many multiples, as this can also lead to a larger set.

Here's an example of how to use this function with `funsearch.run`:

```python
@funsearch.run
def test_priority_v1():
  assert priority_v1(3, 10) == 6
  assert priority_v1(5, 10) == 5
  assert priority_v1(7, 10) == 4
```
