Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]` and the number of missing integers in that range. This version uses the `itertools` library to generate the range and `np` for counting frequencies.

```python
import itertools
import numpy as np

def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
    # Generate the range [1, n]
    range_n = list(range(1, n + 1))

    # Count the frequency of k in the range
    freq_k = range_n.count(k)

    # Count the number of missing integers in the range
    missing = n - len(range_n)

    # Calculate the priority as the frequency of k divided by the number of missing integers
    # Add a small constant to avoid division by zero and to prefer adding k when it's frequent
    return freq_k / (missing + 1e-6)
```

This version of `priority_v1` should provide a better estimate of the priority for adding `k` to the Salem-Spencer set. It prefers integers that are frequent in the range and avoids adding integers that would leave many missing integers in the range.
