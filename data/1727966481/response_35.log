Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the number of elements less than `k` and the number of elements greater than `k` in the Salem-Spencer set. This version uses the harmonic number `H(n)` to weigh the importance of adding `k` to the set.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  less_than_k = sum(1 for i in range(k) if i % 2 == 0)
  greater_than_k = sum(1 for i in range(k + 1, n + 1) if i % 2 == 0)
  h_n = sum(1 / i for i in range(1, n + 1))
  return (less_than_k + greater_than_k) / (2 * h_n)
```

This version makes a small change by considering the parity of the numbers (only even numbers are considered for the Salem-Spencer set) and using the harmonic number to weigh the priority. The code is still short and follows the given instructions.
