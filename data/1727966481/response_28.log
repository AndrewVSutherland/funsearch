Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the number of unique remainders when dividing `k` by `n`, and the number of multiples of `k` within `n`. This version is shorter and makes a small change from `priority_v0`.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  remainders = set(k % i for i in range(1, n + 1))
  multiples = sum(i % k == 0 for i in range(1, n + 1))
  return len(remainders) + multiples
```

This version calculates the priority as the sum of the number of unique remainders and the number of multiples of `k` within `n`. This should give a better indication of the priority for adding `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.
