Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[0, n)` and the number of unique elements in that range. This version uses the formula `priority = frequency / (n * unique_elements)`, which gives higher priority to elements that appear more frequently and have fewer unique elements in their range.

```python
from collections import Counter

@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
    elements = list(range(n))
    freq = Counter(elements).get(k, 0)
    unique_elements = len(set(elements))
    return freq / (n * unique_elements)
```

This version of `priority_v1` makes small changes to `priority_v0` by adding a frequency count and a unique element count, and using them to calculate a more informative priority value. The code is also kept short and readable.
