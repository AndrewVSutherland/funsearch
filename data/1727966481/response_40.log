Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that uses the concept of "information gain" to prioritize elements in the Salem-Spencer set. This version considers the number of unique remainders when dividing by `k` and `n - k`, and the total number of possible remainders. The code is kept short and only small changes are made compared to `priority_v0`.

```python
import math

@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Returns the priority with which we want to add `k` to the salem-spencer set.
    n is the number of possible integers, and k is the integer we want to determine priority for.
    """
    # Calculate unique remainders when dividing by k and n - k
    unique_remainders_k = len(set(range(n)) - set(range(0, n, k)))
    unique_remainders_nk = len(set(range(n)) - set(range(0, n, n - k)))

    # Calculate total possible remainders
    total_remainders = n - 1

    # Calculate information gain as the sum of unique remainders divided by total possible remainders
    info_gain = (unique_remainders_k + unique_remainders_nk) / total_remainders

    # Return the information gain as priority
    return info_gain
```

This version of `priority_v1` should provide a better prioritization for adding elements to the Salem-Spencer set compared to `priority_v0`. The code is short and only small changes were made to improve the priority calculation.
