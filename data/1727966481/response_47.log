Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[0, n)` and the distance from `k` to the middle of the range. This version uses the `itertools` library to count the frequency of `k` and numpy for efficient calculations.

```python
import itertools
import numpy as np

@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
    # Count the frequency of k in the range [0, n)
    freq = sum(1 for _ in itertools.islice(itertools.count(), k, n))

    # Calculate the distance from k to the middle of the range
    mid = n // 2
    dist = abs(k - mid)

    # Return a weighted sum of frequency and distance, with higher frequency and smaller distance having higher priority
    return freq / n + dist / (n - 1)
```

This version of `priority_v1` makes small changes to `priority_v0` by adding a frequency count and a distance calculation, and combining them into a weighted sum to determine priority. The code is kept short by using efficient libraries and concise syntax.
