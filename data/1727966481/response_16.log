Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]` and the number of remaining integers. The idea is to prioritize integers that are less frequent and have more remaining integers to pair with.

```python
from collections import Counter

@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Returns the priority with which we want to add `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.
  n is the number of possible integers, and k is the integer we want to determine priority for.
  """
  # Count the frequency of each integer in the range [1, n]
  freq = Counter(range(1, n + 1))

  # Calculate the priority based on frequency and remaining integers
  priority = -freq[k] * (n - k)

  return priority
```

This version of `priority_v1` makes small changes to `priority_v0` by introducing a frequency count and using it to calculate a more informative priority. The code is also shorter than the original `priority_v0` function.
