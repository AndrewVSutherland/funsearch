Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the number of elements less than `k` that can be added to the Salem-Spencer set. This version uses the combination formula to calculate the number of ways to choose `k-1` elements from the `n-1` smaller integers.

```python
from math import comb

def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
    return comb(n - 1, k - 1)
```

This version makes a small change from `priority_v0` by considering the number of combinations, which should improve the priority calculation. The code is also shorter and more concise.
