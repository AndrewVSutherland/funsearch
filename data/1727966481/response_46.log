Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[0, n)` and the number of possible progressions it can form with other elements in the range. This version uses a simple heuristic to prioritize elements that can form more unique progressions and are less frequent.

```python
from collections import Counter

def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  # Count the frequency of each element in the range [0, n)
  freq = Counter(range(n))

  # Calculate the number of unique progressions that can be formed with k
  progressions = sum(1 for i in range(n) if np.gcd(k, i) == 1)

  # Prioritize based on frequency and the number of unique progressions
  return -freq[k] * progressions
```

This version of `priority_v1` makes a small change from `priority_v0` by considering the frequency of `k` and the number of unique progressions it can form. The priority is calculated as the product of the negative frequency (to prioritize less frequent elements) and the number of unique progressions (to prioritize elements that can form more progressions).
