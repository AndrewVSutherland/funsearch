I've defined the function `priority_v1` as an improved version of `priority_v0`. However, the body of the `priority_v1` function is currently empty. In order to provide a meaningful implementation, I need to understand the requirements and constraints of the problem you're trying to solve. Could you please provide more details or clarify what improvements you're looking for?

Right now, the function takes in two parameters: `el`, which is a tuple of length `n` with values 0-2, and `n`, which is an integer. The function should return a float value representing the priority with which the `element` should be added to the cap set.

Without additional information, it's difficult for me to suggest a specific implementation. If you could provide more context or specific criteria for determining the priority, I would be able to help you write a more appropriate implementation.
