Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of each integer in the range `[1, n]` and the distance from `k` to the nearest integer with a higher frequency. This version uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequencies.

```python
from collections import Counter

def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  freq = Counter(range(1, n + 1))
  freq_k = freq[k]

  # Find the nearest integer with a higher frequency
  higher_freq = min((abs(k - i), i) for i in range(1, n + 1) if freq[i] > freq_k)
  distance, _ = higher_freq

  return freq_k / (distance + 1)
```

This version of `priority_v1` makes a small change from `priority_v0` by considering the frequency of each integer and the distance to the nearest integer with a higher frequency. It returns a priority value that is higher for integers with higher frequencies and closer to integers with even higher frequencies.
