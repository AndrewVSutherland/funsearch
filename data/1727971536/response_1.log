Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the number of unique remainders when dividing `k` by `n`. This is a simple improvement over `priority_v0` and follows the given constraints of making small changes and keeping the code short.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  return len(set(k % i for i in range(1, n + 1)))
```

This version of `priority_v1` calculates the number of unique remainders when dividing `k` by all integers from 1 to `n`. The more unique remainders, the higher the priority, as it indicates that `k` could potentially be part of more Salem-Spencer progressions.
