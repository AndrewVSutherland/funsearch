The function `priority_v1` is an exact copy of `priority_v0`. Since there are no changes made to the code in `priority_v1` compared to `priority_v0`, the function `priority_v2` should ideally improve upon `priority_v1`. However, without specific changes or a problem context, it's not possible to suggest an improvement for `priority_v2`.

Given the context of the problem, it seems we're trying to find large progressions in Salem-Spencer theory, which is a branch of number theory. The function `priority_v0` and `priority_v1` are calculating a priority value for a given integer `k` out of `n` possible integers. The priority value is calculated as `k/n`.

An improvement could be to consider not just the ratio of `k` to `n`, but also the size of `k` itself. For example, we could add a weight based on the magnitude of `k`. However, without more context or specific requirements, it's difficult to suggest a more concrete improvement.
