It seems like you're trying to optimize a function called `priority_vX` that determines the priority of adding an integer `k` to a Salem-Spencer set. The set contains `n` possible integers.

The current version of the function (`priority_v0`) simply returns 0.0, which means that the priority of adding any integer to the set is the same.

To improve this function, you could start by considering the properties of the Salem-Spencer set and the integer `k`. For example, you could return a higher priority for integers that are likely to lead to larger progressions in the set.

Here's a simple way to improve `priority_v0` to `priority_v1`:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  # Return a higher priority for larger integers
  return k / n
```

This version of the function gives a higher priority to larger integers, which might lead to larger progressions in the set.

However, without more specific information about the problem, it's difficult to suggest a more sophisticated improvement. For example, you might want to consider the current state of the Salem-Spencer set when determining the priority of adding a new integer.

For `priority_v2`, I would need more context or specific requirements to provide a meaningful improvement.
