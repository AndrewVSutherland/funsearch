The `priority_v2` function needs to be improved. However, the improvement strategy or criteria are not specified in the provided code. Therefore, I'll provide a simple improvement based on normalizing the priority score by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. This could help to give more weight to the larger numbers and make the priority scores more comparable across different values of `n`.

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int, mean: float, std_dev: float) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v1`. Normalizes the priority score."""
  return (k - mean) / std_dev
```

To use this function, you would need to calculate the mean and standard deviation of all possible integers in the range, and pass these values as arguments to the function.

However, without more specific instructions, it's difficult to provide a more accurate or meaningful improvement.
