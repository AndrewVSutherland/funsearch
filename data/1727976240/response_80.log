The code provided defines a few functions to calculate priorities for adding an integer to a Salem-Spencer set. The Salem-Spencer set is a subset of integers that have certain properties related to the distribution of prime numbers.

The `priority_v0` function currently returns a priority of 0.0 for any integer `k` and any number of possible integers `n`. This means that the function is not currently taking into account any information about `k` or `n` when calculating the priority.

The `priority_v1` function is an improved version of `priority_v0` and should return a priority based on the values of `k` and `n`. However, the current implementation still returns a priority of 0.0.

The `priority_v2` function is another improved version of `priority_v1` and should also return a priority based on the values of `k` and `n`. However, the function is currently not implemented.

To improve the `priority_v1` function, we can use some information about the distribution of prime numbers. For example, we can use the fact that prime numbers are more likely to occur as `k` gets larger. We can also use the fact that the probability of a number being prime decreases as `n` gets larger.

Here is an example implementation of `priority_v1` that uses these facts:
```
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  # Calculate the probability of k being prime
  if k < 2:
    return 0.0
  for i in range(2, int(np.sqrt(k)) + 1):
    if k % i == 0:
      return 0.0
  p_k = 1.0 / np.log(k)  # Using the prime number theorem

  # Calculate the probability of n being composite
  p_n = 1.0 - 1.0 / np.log(n)  # Using the probability that a random number is prime

  # Return the priority as the product of these probabilities
  return p_k * p_n
```
This implementation calculates the probability that `k` is prime using the prime number theorem, and the probability that `n` is composite using the fact that the probability that a random number is prime is `1 / log(n)`. The priority is then calculated as the product of these probabilities.

The `priority_v2` function can be implemented in a similar way, but with additional considerations or improvements. For example, we could consider the distribution of prime gaps or the distribution of primes in arithmetic progressions. We could also use more advanced techniques for estimating the probability of a number being prime, such as the Meissel-Lehmer algorithm.
