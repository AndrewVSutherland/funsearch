Here's how we could improve on `priority_v1`. This version squares the inverse of the number of possible integers as well.

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v1`."""
  return (k / n) ** 2 * (n / (n - 1)) ** 2
```

This approach gives more weight to smaller `k` and larger `n`, which makes sense in the context of the problem. A smaller `k` indicates a smaller integer, and a larger `n` indicates that there are more possible integers. By squaring both fractions, we give more importance to these factors.

Note that we need to be careful to avoid division by zero when `n` is 1. In that case, we could return 0 as the priority, or we could return a very small number to indicate that this element should be considered last.
