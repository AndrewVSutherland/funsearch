Here is an improved version of `priority_v0` that uses the idea of maximizing the number of unique differences between the elements in the Salem-Spencer set. This is because larger differences can lead to larger progressions.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, ss_set: set) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  if not ss_set:
    return 1.0
  else:
    return 1 / max(abs(k - ss_element) for ss_element in ss_set)
```

In this function, `ss_set` is the current Salem-Spencer set. If the set is empty, we return a priority of 1.0, as this is the first element of the set.

If the set is not empty, we calculate the priority as the reciprocal of the maximum difference between the current integer `k` and any integer in the set `ss_set`. This means that integers that are far from any integer in the set will have a higher priority.

This function assumes that the set `ss_set` does not contain `k`. If `k` might be in the set, you can modify the function to return 0 if `k` is in the set.
