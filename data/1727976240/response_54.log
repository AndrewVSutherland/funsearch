In the context of finding large SS progressions, the `priority_v2` function could be improved by considering the distribution of numbers in the set so far. This could be done by maintaining a histogram of the numbers in the set and using this to prioritize numbers that are less frequently represented. Here's how this could be implemented:

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int, histogram: np.ndarray) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v2`."""

  # Prioritize larger numbers and numbers close to half of n (symmetry consideration)
  symmetry_priority = k / n + abs(k - n / 2) / (n / 2)

  # Prioritize numbers that are less frequently represented in the set so far
  frequency_priority = 1 / (histogram[k] + 1)  # Add 1 to avoid division by zero

  # Combine the two priorities
  return symmetry_priority * frequency_priority
```

In this version, `histogram` is a numpy array of length `n` that contains the frequency of each number in the set so far. The `frequency_priority` variable is then computed as the reciprocal of the frequency of `k` in the set so far, plus one to avoid division by zero. The `symmetry_priority` variable is computed as in `priority_v1`. The two priorities are then combined by multiplication.
