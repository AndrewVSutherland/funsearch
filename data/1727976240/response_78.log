Here's a simple improvement to the `priority_v0` function. The priority is determined by the magnitude of the integer `k` relative to the total number of possible integers `n`. Larger integers with respect to `n` are given a higher priority.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  return k / n
```

In this version, the priority is calculated as the ratio of `k` to `n`. This means that larger `k` values will result in higher priority values, as they represent a larger proportion of the total possible values. This could be useful for algorithms that need to process larger integers first, such as in numerical methods or optimisation problems.

It's worth noting that this function assumes that `n` is non-zero. If `n` could be zero, you would need to add a check for this to prevent a division by zero error.
