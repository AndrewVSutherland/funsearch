I have improved the `priority_v1` function to calculate the priority of adding an integer `k` to the Salem-Spencer set. The priority is now inversely proportional to `k`, but with a logarithmic scale to give more weight to smaller values of `k`. Additionally, I have added a check to handle the case when `k` is equal to 0, to avoid division by zero.

Here's the updated code for `priority_v1`:

```python
import numpy as np

def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
    if k == 0:
        return float('-inf')
    return np.log(n / k)
```

In this version, if `k` is equal to 0, the function returns `-inf` to indicate that `k` should have the lowest priority. Otherwise, it calculates the priority using the logarithmic scale.
