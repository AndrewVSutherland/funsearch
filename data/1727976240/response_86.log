The `priority_v2` function is not provided in the code snippet. Based on the improvement pattern, I can infer a possible improvement:

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v1`.

  Returns a priority value that is proportional to the square of `k`, the integer for which priority is calculated.
  """
  return (k / n) ** 2
```

In this version, the priority is calculated based on the square of the integer `k`, which might give more weight to larger numbers. However, without more context or specific requirements, it's difficult to say whether this is the most appropriate improvement.
