I've made a small improvement to the `priority_v1` function. Now, it calculates the priority based on the ratio of `k` to `n`. This ratio represents the proportion of possible integers that `k` occupies. A higher ratio indicates a higher priority. If `n` is zero, the function returns 0 to avoid division by zero.

Here's the updated code:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`.
  Calculates the priority based on the ratio of `k` to `n`.
  """
  if n == 0:
    return 0.0
  return k / n
```

You can use this function to determine the priority of an integer `k` among `n` possible integers.
