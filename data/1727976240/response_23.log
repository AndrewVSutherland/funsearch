Sure, let's improve the `priority_v0` function to `priority_v1`. For this problem, we can assume that a higher priority should be given to larger numbers because they contribute more to a large SS progression. Here's a simple way to modify the priority function to reflect this:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`.
  Here, priority is determined by the ratio of k to n, which represents the proportion of the total possible integers.
  """
  return k / n
```

This function will return a value between 0 and 1, where 1 represents the highest priority (the largest possible integer) and 0 represents the lowest priority (the smallest possible integer).
