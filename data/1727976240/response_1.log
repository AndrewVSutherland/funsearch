It seems like you're trying to implement a function that calculates the priority of an integer `k` to be added to a Salem-Spencer set, given the total number of possible integers `n`. The priority is determined by a certain scoring system.

The initial version of the function, `priority_v0`, is currently returning 0.0 for all inputs, which is not very useful. Your task is to improve upon this function in `priority_v1`.

However, without additional context or specific requirements about how the priority should be calculated, it's difficult to suggest an improvement. Could you please provide more details or clarify the scoring system you're using?
