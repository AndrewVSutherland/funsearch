It seems like you're trying to improve a function that calculates a priority value for adding an integer to a Salem-Spencer set. The function takes two arguments: `k`, the integer to determine the priority for, and `n`, the number of possible integers.

Here's a possible improvement for `priority_v1`:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`.
  This version returns a higher priority for larger values of k."""
  return k / n
```

This version of the function returns a priority that is proportional to the value of `k` divided by the total number of possible integers `n`. This means that larger values of `k` will have a higher priority.
