In order to improve the priority function, we can consider the following:

1. The larger the number, the less likely it is to be part of a large SS progression.
2. The number's divisors and the gap between them could be important.

Therefore, we could return a higher priority for smaller numbers and for numbers with fewer divisors or with a large gap between them.

Here is one possible version:

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v1`."""
  divisors = [i for i in range(1, k + 1) if k % i == 0]
  if len(divisors) <= 2:  # If k is a prime number or 1
    return 1.0 / k
  else:
    divisors_gap = [divisors[i+1] - divisors[i] for i in range(len(divisors) - 1)]
    max_gap = max(divisors_gap)
    return 1.0 / (k * max_gap)
```

The `priority_v2` function first computes the divisors of `k`. If `k` is a prime number or 1, it assigns a high priority (inverse of `k`). For numbers with more than two divisors, it calculates the maximum gap between any two consecutive divisors and assigns a priority based on this gap (inverse of `k` times the maximum gap).

This function still needs to be further improved, for example by taking into account the distribution of numbers in the Salem-Spencer set, but it provides a more informed guess about the likelihood of a number being part of a large SS progression.
