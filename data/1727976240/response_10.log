Here's an improved version of `priority_v0` that considers the size of the number `k` and its divisors:

```python
import itertools
import numpy as np
import funsearch

def divisors(n):
    """Returns the number of divisors of `n`."""
    return sum(2 for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1) if n % i == 0)

@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`.

    This version considers the size of the number `k` and its divisors.
    A larger number with fewer divisors is prioritized higher.
    """
    return k / divisors(k)
```

This version of the function calculates the priority as the ratio of the number `k` to the number of its divisors. This way, larger numbers with fewer divisors (which are less likely to be divisible by other numbers) are prioritized higher.
