This is a code for finding large Salem-Spencer progressions. The code defines a function `priority_v0` that calculates the priority with which we want to add a given integer `k` to the Salem-Spencer set. The priority is calculated as the product of two factors: the first factor favors larger numbers, and the second factor penalizes numbers that are close to multiples of previous numbers in the progression.

The code also defines two improved versions of `priority_v0`, `priority_v1` and `priority_v2`. However, the code for `priority_v2` is not provided. To improve the code, we can make a small change to `priority_v1` to incorporate the second factor from `priority_v0`.

Here's the improved version of `priority_v1` that incorporates the second factor:

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int, progression: list) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v1`."""
  previous_number = max(progression, default=1)
  return (k / n) * (1 - (k % previous_number) / previous_number)
```

In this version, we pass the current progression as an argument to the function. We then use the largest number in the progression as the previous number, and calculate the second factor in the same way as in `priority_v0`.
