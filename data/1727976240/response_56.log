The next iteration of the `priority_v1` function could consider the distribution of the numbers already in the Salem-Spencer set. If the set is already skewed towards higher or lower numbers, the priority might be adjusted accordingly. However, without more context or specific requirements, it's difficult to propose a more concrete improvement. Here's a simple adjustment that takes into account the mean of the existing numbers:

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int, existing_numbers: list) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v1`."""
  mean_existing = np.mean(existing_numbers) if existing_numbers else 0
  return abs(k - mean_existing) / n
```

This version of the `priority_v2` function calculates the absolute difference between `k` and the mean of the existing numbers in the Salem-Spencer set, then divides by `n`. This prioritizes numbers that are closer to the mean of the existing set.
