To improve upon the previous versions of the `priority_vX` functions, I'll consider the distribution of integers in the Salem-Spencer set and how the new integer `k` contributes to the overall progression.

The updated `priority_v2` function could consider the gap between the maximum integer in the Salem-Spencer set and `k`. A larger gap indicates that `k` is farther from the current progression and may require more iterations to incorporate into the set.

Here's an improved version of the `priority_v2` function:

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int, max_ss: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v1`.

  The priority is calculated as a combination of k/n and the gap between the maximum integer in the Salem-Spencer set and k.
  A larger gap indicates a larger contribution to the overall progression.
  """
  gap = k - max_ss
  return (k / n) + (1 / gap if gap > 0 else 0)
```

In this version, `max_ss` is the maximum integer in the Salem-Spencer set. The priority is a sum of two terms: the first term is the ratio of `k` to `n`, and the second term is the reciprocal of the gap between `k` and `max_ss`. If `k` is less than or equal to `max_ss`, the second term is 0.

This approach takes into account both the relative size of `k` and its distance from the current progression, providing a more informed priority value.
