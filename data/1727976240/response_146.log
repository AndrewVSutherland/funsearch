The given code is a Python script that defines a function `priority_v1` which takes two integer arguments `k` and `n`. The function `priority_v0` is also defined, but it is not being used in the current context.

The function `priority_v1` is expected to return a priority value as a float between 0 and 1. The exact calculation or implementation of the priority value is not provided.

To improve the `priority_v1` function, we could add the necessary calculations based on the problem statement or requirements. Without additional information, it's challenging to suggest specific improvements.
