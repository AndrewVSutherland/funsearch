Sure, I'd be happy to help improve your code. In the context of your problem, it seems like you're trying to determine the priority of an integer `k` to be added to a Salem-Spencer set, given the total number of possible integers `n`. Here's a simple improvement:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`.

  This version prioritizes larger numbers as they might contribute more to the progression.
  """
  return k / n
```

In this version, the priority is calculated as the ratio of `k` to `n`. This means that larger numbers will have a higher priority, as they contribute more to the overall progression. However, this is a very basic improvement and the actual priority calculation might depend on other factors or constraints in your problem.
