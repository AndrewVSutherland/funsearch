In the code provided, we have a function `priority_v0` that currently returns a constant value of 0.0, regardless of the input `k` and `n`. The task is to improve this function in the subsequent version, `priority_v1`, by implementing a more meaningful priority calculation based on the input values.

Without specific requirements for the priority calculation, it's difficult to suggest an exact implementation. However, a simple improvement could be to return a value that is higher for larger `k` values, as this might indicate a more desirable element to add to the Salem-Spencer set. Here's a possible implementation for this:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`.

  Returns a priority value that is proportional to `k`, the integer for which priority is calculated.
  """
  return k / n
```

In this implementation, the priority value is calculated as the ratio of `k` to `n`. This means that elements with higher `k` values will have a higher priority. The ratio is used to normalize the priority value to be between 0 and 1, regardless of the range of `k` and `n`.
