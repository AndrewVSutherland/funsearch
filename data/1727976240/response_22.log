Since the problem statement does not specify how the priority should be calculated, I will assume that we want to prioritize larger numbers and numbers closer to the middle of the range. The priority will be calculated as the sum of the absolute difference between the number and the middle of the range, and the number itself.

Here is the improved version of `priority_v0`:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  mid = n // 2
  return abs(k - mid) + k
```

In this version, `mid` is the middle of the range of possible integers. The priority is calculated as the sum of the absolute difference between `k` and `mid`, and `k` itself. This will give higher priority to numbers closer to the middle of the range and larger numbers.
