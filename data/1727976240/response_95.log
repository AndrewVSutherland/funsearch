The problem is about finding large SS progressions, which are sequences of integers that follow a specific pattern. The goal is to improve a priority function that determines the order in which to add integers to the Salem-Spencer set. The function takes two arguments: `k`, the integer for which we want to calculate the priority, and `n`, the total number of possible integers. The priority function should return a float that indicates the priority of adding `k` to the set.

The code provided defines three functions: `priority_v0`, `priority_v1`, and `priority_v2`. The task is to improve `priority_v1` and `priority_v2` based on the previous version, while making only small changes. The code should be as short as possible.

Here's the solution for `priority_v1` and `priority_v2`:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  # Prioritize integers closer to the middle of the range
  return 1.0 / abs(k - n // 2)

def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v1`."""
  # Prioritize integers closer to the middle of the range, but with a smaller weight for distance
  return 1.0 / (abs(k - n // 2) + 1)
```

In `priority_v1`, the priority is calculated as the reciprocal of the absolute difference between the integer `k` and the middle of the range `n // 2`. This means that integers closer to the middle of the range have a higher priority.

In `priority_v2`, the priority is calculated similarly to `priority_v1`, but with a small modification to the denominator. Adding a constant to the denominator ensures that all integers have a non-zero priority, and slightly decreases the priority of integers that are far from the middle of the range. This helps to balance the trade-off between exploring different parts of the range and focusing on integers that are likely to be part of a large SS progression.
