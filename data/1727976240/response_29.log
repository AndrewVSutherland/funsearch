Importing the necessary libraries and modules, I have defined a function `priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:` that takes two integer arguments: `k` and `n`. This function is designed to return a priority value for adding the integer `k` to a Salem-Spencer set, given a total number of possible integers `n`.

However, it seems that the implementation of the function is missing. In the current script, the body of the function is empty. I can't run the function as is, but when the function's body is implemented, it will return the priority value as described.

If you provide the implementation of the function, I can execute it and give you the results. Could you please share the mathematical formula or the logic used to calculate the priority value?
