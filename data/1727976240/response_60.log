It seems like there's a bit of confusion in the description and the code. The description asks to improve upon the `priority_vX` methods, but only `priority_v0` and `priority_v1` are defined in the code.

However, I can suggest an improvement for `priority_v1` based on the description. Since we want to find large SS progressions, we might want to prioritize larger numbers over smaller ones. One way to do this could be to use the square of the number `k` instead of `k` in the priority calculation. This would give larger numbers a higher priority, increasing the likelihood of finding larger SS progressions.

Here's how you could modify `priority_v1` to implement this:

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v1`.

  The priority is calculated as k^2/n, which gives a higher weight to larger numbers.
  """
  return (k ** 2) / n
```

This is a small change that should improve the performance of the algorithm, focusing more on finding larger SS progressions.
