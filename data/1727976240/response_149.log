To improve the priority_v1 function over priority_v0, we can modify the calculation of the priority value. In the original priority_v0 function, the priority is simply the ratio of the integer k to the total number of possible integers n.

In the priority_v1 function, we can make a small change by considering the square root of the integer k. This change will give more weight to larger integers, which may lead to better results in finding large SS progressions.

Here's the modified priority_v1 function:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`.

  Returns the priority with which we want to add `element` to the Salem-Spencer set.
  n is the number of possible integers, and k is the integer we want to determine priority for.
  """
  return np.sqrt(k) / n
```

In this version, the priority is calculated as the square root of k divided by n. This modification should help in identifying larger SS progressions.
