Based on the problem description, it seems that we're working with Salem-Spencer sets and trying to improve the priority function used to select elements for these sets.

The initial version of the priority function, `priority_v0`, doesn't seem to do anything meaningful as it always returns 0.0 regardless of the input.

Given the small changes and the focus on making the code short, I'll start by improving `priority_v0` to return a simple priority based on the ratio of `k` to `n`. A larger `k` relative to `n` might indicate a more promising candidate for the Salem-Spencer set.

Let's implement this in `priority_v1`:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  return k / n
```

Now let's run this function to see how it behaves.
```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  return k / n

# Testing the function
print(priority_v1(10, 20))  # Expected output: 0.5
print(priority_v1(20, 10))  # Expected output: 2.0
```
