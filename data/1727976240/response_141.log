To improve the `priority_v1` function over the `priority_v0` function, I'll modify it to return the reciprocal of the integer `k` multiplied by the square root of `n`. This prioritization takes into account both the value of `k` and the total number of possible integers `n`. The reciprocal of `k` ensures that larger values of `k` have lower priority, while the square root of `n` helps to normalize the priority values based on the size of `n`.

Here's the updated `priority_v1` function:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  return 1.0 / (k * np.sqrt(n))
```

Now let's execute the code to see the results.
```python
import numpy as np

def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  return 1.0 / (k * np.sqrt(n))

# Test the function with some example inputs
print(priority_v1(5, 100))
print(priority_v1(10, 100))
print(priority_v1(5, 200))
print(priority_v1(10, 200))
```
