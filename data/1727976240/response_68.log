The function `priority_v1` takes two parameters, `k` and `n`, and should return a float that reflects the priority with which we want to add `k` to the Salem-Spencer set. In this case, the priority is improved over the `priority_v0` function by considering the relationship between `k` and `n`.

Without any additional context or information about the specific problem or task, it's difficult to suggest a specific improvement over the `priority_v0` function. However, one possible way to improve the priority function could be to normalize the value of `k` by dividing it by `n`, which would give a priority value between 0 and 1. This would make the priority more comparable and easier to interpret, especially when dealing with different ranges of possible integers.

Here's an example of how the `priority_v1` function could be implemented based on this idea:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  return float(k) / n
```

This way, the priority value for each integer will be relative to the total number of possible integers, which could be useful for certain types of problems or tasks.
