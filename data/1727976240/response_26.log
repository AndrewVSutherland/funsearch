The problem statement is to find large SS progressions, which are sequences of numbers that satisfy certain conditions. The task is to improve a priority function that determines the order in which numbers are added to the Salem-Spencer set. The priority function should be improved over iterations, with small changes made at each step. The code should be as short as possible.

Here's an improved version of the `priority_v1` function:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
    if k == 0 or k == n:
        return 0.0
    else:
        return 1.0 / (k * (n - k))
```

This version of the function returns 0.0 for the first and last element of the sequence (since they cannot be part of a progression), and a value inversely proportional to the product of the distance from the first element and the distance from the last element for all other elements. This prioritizes elements that are closer to the middle of the sequence.

The time complexity of this function is O(1), and the space complexity is also O(1), since it only uses a constant amount of space to store the result.
