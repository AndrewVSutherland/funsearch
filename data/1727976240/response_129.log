Sure, I'd be happy to help you improve your `priority_v1` function. However, I need more information about the context and the specific criteria for improving the priority.

Assuming that a higher priority should be given to larger numbers and numbers that are more unique among a set of integers, here's a possible improvement:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int, set_ss: set) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  # The priority is a combination of the size of the number and its uniqueness
  # Uniqueness is calculated as 1 / (number of occurrences in the set_ss)
  # Size is calculated as the number itself
  # The priority is the sum of these two values
  return k + 1 / (set_ss.count(k) + 1)
```

This function calculates the priority as the sum of the number itself and the reciprocal of its frequency in the Salem-Spencer set. This way, larger numbers and numbers that are less frequent in the set have a higher priority.
