Sure, I can help with that. The priority_v1 function could be improved by considering the position of the integer `k` in the range of possible integers. A simple approach could be to give higher priority to numbers closer to the middle of the range, as they have more potential to form large progressions. Here's a simple way to do it:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  # Calculate the distance from the middle of the range
  distance_from_middle = abs(k - n // 2)

  # The priority is inversely proportional to the distance from the middle
  priority = 1 / (distance_from_middle + 1)

  return priority
```

This priority function returns values between 0 and 1, with numbers closer to the middle of the range having higher priority. The `+ 1` in the denominator is to avoid division by zero when `k` is exactly in the middle of the range.
