This `priority_v1` function should take into account the total number of possible integers `n` when determining the priority of adding integer `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.

To improve upon `priority_v0`, we might take into account the proportion of `k` relative to `n`. However, since `k` and `n` are integers, `k / n` will be a float between 0 and 1. This could be a suitable measure of priority, but it might not lead to the "large SS progressions" that the problem statement seems to suggest.

If we want to find large progressions, we might need to consider other aspects of the numbers, such as their prime factors or their position in a sequence. However, without more specific criteria, it's difficult to suggest an improvement to `priority_v1`.

Here's a simple improvement that uses the proportion of `k` to `n`:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  return float(k) / float(n)
```

This function will return a value between 0 and 1, with larger values indicating higher priority. However, this might not be the best way to find large progressions, and the specifics of the problem statement might suggest a different approach.
