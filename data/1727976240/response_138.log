To improve the priority calculation over the previous iterations, we can take into account the number of common divisors between the existing elements in the Salem-Spencer set and the new element we want to add. This can help us identify larger progressions.

Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that takes into account the number of common divisors:

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int, existing_set: set) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the number of common divisors."""
    # Calculate the number of common divisors between k and the existing elements in the set
    common_divisors = sum(1 for x in existing_set if np.gcd(k, x) > 1)

    # Return the priority as the number of common divisors divided by the total number of elements in the set
    return common_divisors / len(existing_set)
```

In this version, we pass an additional parameter `existing_set` which contains the existing elements in the Salem-Spencer set. We then calculate the number of common divisors between `k` and each element in the `existing_set`. Finally, we return the priority as the ratio of the number of common divisors to the total number of elements in the set.

By considering the number of common divisors, we can prioritize elements that contribute to larger progressions in the Salem-Spencer set.
