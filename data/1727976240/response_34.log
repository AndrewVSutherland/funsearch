It seems like you're trying to improve a function that calculates a priority score for adding a certain integer `k` to a Salem-Spencer set, with `n` being the total number of possible integers.

The current function `priority_v0` always returns 0.0, which is not very helpful. I'll suggest a simple modification for `priority_v1` where the priority is directly proportional to `k` (the integer we're considering for addition). This means that larger integers will have a higher priority.

Here's the updated function:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`. Priority is directly proportional to `k`."""
  return k / n
```

This function will return a value between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates the highest possible priority (for the largest possible integer `k`). This implementation assumes that all integers are equally likely to be chosen for addition to the Salem-Spencer set, which may not be the case in your specific problem context. You might want to adjust the priority calculation according to your needs.
