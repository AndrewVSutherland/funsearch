We can make a small improvement to `priority_v2` by considering the distribution of numbers in the Salem-Spencer set. We know that the elements of the set are roughly equally spaced. Therefore, we can introduce a penalty for numbers that are too close to each other.

Here's how we can modify `priority_v2`:

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int, ss_set: set) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v1`."""

  # Prioritize larger numbers and numbers close to half of n (symmetry consideration)
  priority = k / n + abs(k - n / 2) / (n / 2)

  # Introduce a penalty for numbers that are too close to each other
  penalty = sum(abs(k - num) for num in ss_set)

  return priority - penalty
```

In this version, `ss_set` is the current Salem-Spencer set. We subtract a penalty from the priority that is equal to the sum of the distances from `k` to all numbers in `ss_set`. This will discourage adding numbers that are too close to each other.
