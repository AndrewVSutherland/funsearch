Here's an improvement over `priority_v0` that considers the sequence of numbers already in the Salem-Spencer set and the potential impact of adding the new number `k` to it. The priority is higher for numbers that are likely to lead to larger progressions in future iterations.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int, salem_spencer_set: set) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  # Calculate the difference between k and the maximum number in the Salem-Spencer set
  max_diff = k - max(salem_spencer_set)

  # Calculate the difference between the minimum number in the Salem-Spencer set and k
  min_diff = min(salem_spencer_set) - k

  # The priority is the maximum of the two differences divided by n
  priority = max(max_diff, min_diff) / n

  return priority
```

In this version, `salem_spencer_set` is the set of numbers already in the Salem-Spencer set. The priority of a number is determined by its maximum difference with the numbers in the set, divided by the total number of possible integers `n`. This prioritizes numbers that are likely to create larger gaps with the existing numbers in the set, which may lead to larger progressions in future iterations.
