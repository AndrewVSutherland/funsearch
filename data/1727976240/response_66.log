The function `priority_v2` is not defined in the provided code. I will define it based on the pattern of the previous versions. The priority is calculated as k^3/n, which gives even more weight to larger numbers. Here is the updated code:

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v1`."""
  return (k ** 3) / n
```

This function takes two arguments, `k` and `n`, and calculates the priority as the cube of `k` divided by `n`. This change makes the function more sensitive to larger values of `k`, giving them a higher priority.
