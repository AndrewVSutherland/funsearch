It seems like you're working on a function to determine the priority of adding an integer to a Salem-Spencer set. This function should take two arguments: the integer `k` and the total number of possible integers `n`. The function should return a float value representing the priority of adding `k` to the set.

I've started by defining a function `priority_v1` as an improved version of `priority_v0`, but there's no code provided for `priority_v1` yet.

To improve the `priority_v0` function, we could consider the following:

1. The priority could be based on the size of the integer. Larger integers could have a higher priority.
2. We could also consider the ratio of the integer to the total number of possible integers.
3. The priority could be based on the frequency of the integer in the set of possible integers.

Here's a simple improvement that takes the size of the integer and the total number of possible integers into account:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  return k / n
```

This function returns a value between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates that `k` is the largest possible integer and 0 indicates that `k` is 0. This might not be the most optimal priority function, but it's a start.
