Sure, I'd be happy to help with that. The `priority_v1` function could be improved by considering the frequency of `k` in the range of possible integers `n`. A simple way to do this could be to return the inverse of the frequency of `k`. This way, numbers that are rarer (less frequent) will have a higher priority. Here's how you might implement that:

```python
import collections

def priority_v1(k: int, n: int, data: list) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`.
  `data` is a list of all possible integers.
  """
  frequency = collections.Counter(data)[k]
  return 1 / frequency if frequency != 0 else 0
```

In this function, `collections.Counter(data)` is used to count the frequency of each integer in `data`, and `frequency = collections.Counter(data)[k]` gets the frequency of `k`. The priority is then calculated as `1 / frequency` if `frequency` is not zero, to avoid division by zero. If `frequency` is zero, the priority is 0, meaning that `k` does not appear in `data`.
