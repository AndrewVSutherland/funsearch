# And so on... The pattern is clear. We can continue this process indefinitely, but each improvement will be less significant than the last.
# The priority function could be made more complex, but it would also be more difficult to compute and understand.
# At some point, the complexity of the priority function would outweigh its benefits.
# Therefore, I will stop here and use priority_v10 as the final version.
