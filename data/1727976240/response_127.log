It seems there's a mistake in your last message. The `priority_v2` function is missing its implementation. However, based on the comments in the `priority_v1` function, I can infer that the `priority_v2` function might be a further refinement of `priority_v1` with additional improvements or modifications.

Unfortunately, without the specific details of these improvements or modifications, it's not possible for me to provide an accurate implementation of `priority_v2`.

Could you please provide more details or clarify your requirements? I'm here to help!
