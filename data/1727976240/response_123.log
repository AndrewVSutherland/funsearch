Here's an improved version of `priority_v1`. This version considers both even and odd k values, but it gives a higher priority to numbers that are divisible by 3. The reasoning behind this is that numbers divisible by 3 tend to have larger gaps between them and are therefore more likely to be part of a large SS progression.

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v1`."""
  if k % 3 == 0:
    return (k / n) ** 3.5
  elif k % 2 == 0:
    return (k / n) ** 3
  else:
    return (k / n) ** 2
```

This version of the function still emphasizes the importance of larger numbers (through the use of the `(k / n)` term), but it also gives a slight boost to numbers that are divisible by 3. This should help to find more large SS progressions.
