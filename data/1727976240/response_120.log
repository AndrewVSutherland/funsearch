The code provided includes three functions that calculate the priority of adding a number to a Salem-Spencer set. The priority is used to determine which numbers to add to the set in order to find large Salem-Spencer progressions.

The `priority_v0` function calculates the priority by favoring larger numbers and penalizing smaller numbers. It also penalizes numbers that are close to multiples of previous numbers in the progression. The priority is calculated as the product of two factors: `k / n`, which favors larger numbers, and `1 - (k % previous_number) / previous_number`, which penalizes numbers that are close to multiples of previous numbers.

The `priority_v1` function is an improved version of `priority_v0`, but it only favors larger numbers and does not penalize smaller numbers or numbers that are close to multiples of previous numbers.

The `priority_v2` function is an improved version of `priority_v1`, but it does not include any code. In order to improve `priority_v1`, we could consider adding a penalty for numbers that are close to multiples of previous numbers, similar to the penalty used in `priority_v0`.

Here's an example of how we could modify `priority_v1` to include a similar penalty:
```
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int, progression: List[int]) -> float:
    previous_number = max(progression, default=1)
    return (k / n) * (1 - (k % previous_number) / previous_number)
```
In this version of the function, we include an additional argument `progression`, which is a list of the numbers in the progression so far. We then calculate the previous number in the progression as the maximum number in the list, or 1 if the list is empty. The penalty for numbers that are close to multiples of previous numbers is the same as in `priority_v0`.
