To improve the `priority_v0` function, we can consider the following:

1. Factors of the integer `k`: The larger the number of factors, the more likely `k` is to contribute to a large sum in the Salem-Spencer set. Therefore, we can count the number of factors of `k` and use this as a basis for the priority.

2. Size of the integer `k`: Larger integers are more likely to contribute a larger value to the sum, thus they should have a higher priority.

3. Ratio of `k` to `n`: This can give us an idea of the relative size of `k` compared to the possible integers.

4. Distribution of `k` within the range of possible integers: If `k` is near the middle of the range, it may be more likely to contribute to a large sum than if it is near the ends of the range.

5. Avoiding duplicates: In the Salem-Spencer set, we want to avoid duplicate values. So, if `k` is already in the set, we may want to give it a lower priority.

Here's an improved version of the `priority_v1` function that takes these factors into account:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int, ss_set: set) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  # Count the number of factors of k
  factors = len(list(itertools.chain(*(i, n//i)
                 for i in range(1, int(n**0.5)+1) if n % i == 0))))

  # Calculate the ratio of k to n
  ratio = k / n

  # Calculate the distribution of k within the range of possible integers
  distribution = abs(0.5 - (k / (n + 1)))

  # Avoid duplicates
  duplicate = 1.0 if k in ss_set else 0.0

  # Combine the factors
  priority = k * factors * (1 - ratio) * (1 - distribution) - duplicate

  return priority
```

This function calculates the priority based on the number of factors of `k`, its ratio to `n`, its distribution within the range of possible integers, and whether it's already in the Salem-Spencer set. The priority is calculated as the product of these factors, minus a penalty for duplicates.
