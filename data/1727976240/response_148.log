The existing code is a little confusing and unclear about the improvements made in each iteration of the priority function. Here, I'll provide a more structured and clear version of the code, with comments that explain what improvements are made at each step.

```python
import funsearch

@funsearch.run
def priority_v0(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """
    Returns the priority with which we want to add `k` to the salem-spencer set.
    n is the number of possible integers, and k is the integer we want to determine priority for.
    """
    # Priority is simply the ratio of the current integer to the total possible integers
    return k / n

def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """
    Improved version of `priority_v0`.
    """
    # In this version, we are considering the ratio of the remaining integers to the total
    # This gives more priority to the larger integers, which might lead to larger SS progressions
    return (n - k) / n

def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """
    Improved version of `priority_v1`.
    """
    # In this version, we are taking the square root of the priority calculated in `priority_v1`
    # This might help in distributing the priority more evenly across the integers
    return (priority_v1(k, n)) ** 0.5
```

This is a common pattern in machine learning and optimization problems to iteratively improve a solution. However, without more context it's hard to say whether these improvements are actually beneficial or not. They might lead to better results, but it's also possible that they don't improve the outcome and just add unnecessary complexity to the code.
