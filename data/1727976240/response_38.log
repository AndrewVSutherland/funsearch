In the provided code, the priority_v1 function is not implemented. However, I can suggest an improvement to the priority_v0 function by taking into account the properties of Salem-Spencer sets and the integer k.

Salem-Spencer sets are a sequence of integers that satisfy certain conditions, and they are known to have large gaps between consecutive elements. Therefore, a simple improvement could be to give higher priority to integers that are further away from the previously added elements, as they are more likely to contribute to large gaps.

Here's a suggested implementation for priority_v1:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int, salem_spencer_set: set) -> float:
    """
    Returns the priority with which we want to add `k` to the salem-spencer set.
    n is the number of possible integers, and k is the integer we want to determine priority for.
    salem_spencer_set is the current Salem-Spencer set.
    """
    if not salem_spencer_set:
        return 0.0

    # Calculate the minimum gap between k and the elements in the salem_spencer_set
    min_gap = min(abs(k - x) for x in salem_spencer_set)

    # Return the inverse of the minimum gap as priority
    return 1.0 / min_gap
```

This implementation calculates the minimum gap between k and the elements in the current Salem-Spencer set, and returns the inverse of the minimum gap as the priority. This way, integers that are further away from the elements in the set will have a higher priority.
