It appears that you're trying to improve a function called `priority_v0` which returns a priority score for adding an integer `k` to a Salem-Spencer set, given the total number of possible integers `n`.

Without specific requirements or a clear direction, it's difficult to suggest a specific improvement. However, a common approach in these scenarios is to consider the properties of the integer `k` and the total number of possible integers `n`.

Here's a simple suggestion: If we assume that larger integers are more likely to lead to larger progressions (sequences of numbers with a common difference), we could return the value of `k` as the priority. This way, larger integers will be more likely to be added to the set.

Here's how you could implement this in Python:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  return float(k)
```

This function simply returns the value of `k` as a float, which can be used as a priority score. However, this is a very basic suggestion and the actual improvement could depend on the specific requirements and constraints of your problem.
