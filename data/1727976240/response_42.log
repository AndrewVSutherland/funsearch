Sure, I'd be happy to help you improve your `priority_v1` function. Based on your description, it seems like you want to improve the priority calculation for adding an integer `k` to the Salem-Spencer set. The function should take into account the total number of possible integers `n`.

Here's a simple improvement over `priority_v0` that considers both `k` and `n`. This version returns a higher priority for smaller `k` values and lower `n` values, which might be more desirable for your application:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
    return float(n / k)
```

This function calculates the priority as the ratio of the total number of possible integers `n` to the integer we want to determine priority for `k`. This means that smaller `k` values and lower `n` values will result in higher priority.
