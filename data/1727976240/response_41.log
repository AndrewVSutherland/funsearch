It seems like there's a bit of a disconnect in the instructions and the provided code. The instructions ask for improvements to be made on the `priority_v1` and subsequent versions, but the code provided only contains a definition for `priority_v0`.

Given the description and the existing code, I can suggest improvements based on common practices in optimizing such priority functions. The goal is often to maximize the priority for desired outcomes, so we might want to favor larger numbers and those closer to the middle of the range. We could also consider the distribution of existing numbers in the set to avoid duplicates or overly similar numbers.

Here's a possible improvement for `priority_v1`:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int, existing: set) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`.
  Existing is a set of integers already in the Salem-Spencer set.
  """
  # Prioritize larger numbers and numbers close to half of n (symmetry consideration)
  priority = k / n + abs(k - n / 2) / (n / 2)

  # Penalize duplicates and numbers too close to existing numbers
  for e in existing:
    if abs(k - e) < n / 10:  # adjust this threshold as needed
      priority *= 0.5

  return priority
```

This version of the function still favors larger numbers and those closer to the middle, but it also considers the existing numbers in the set. If a number is too close to an existing number, its priority is reduced to discourage adding it to the set.
