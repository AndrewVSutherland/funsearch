Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that takes into account the number of divisors of a given integer:

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v1`."""
  def num_divisors(n):
    """Returns the number of divisors of n."""
    count = 1
    p = 2
    while p * p <= n:
      if n % p:
        p += 1
      else:
        n //= p
        count += 1
    if n > 1:
      count += 1
    return count

  return k / n * num_divisors(k)
```

This version of the function returns the product of `k / n` and the number of divisors of `k`. The idea is that integers with more divisors are likely to lead to more progressions in the Salem-Spencer sequence, so they should have higher priority.
