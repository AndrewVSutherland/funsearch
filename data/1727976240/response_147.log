```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`.
    Returns the priority of `k` as a float between 0 and 1.
    In this version, the priority is calculated as the logarithm of `k` divided by the logarithm of `n`.
    This prioritizes smaller numbers more than the original version.
    """
    return np.log(k) / np.log(n)
```
I have modified the `priority_v1` function to calculate the priority of `k` as the logarithm of `k` divided by the logarithm of `n`. This approach will prioritize smaller numbers more than the original version. The priority is a float between 0 and 1.
