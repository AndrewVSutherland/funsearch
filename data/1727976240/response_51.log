Here's a small improvement to your `priority_v1` function, based on your instructions and the context given:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`.
  The priority is calculated as the cube of `k` over the cube of `n`.
  This change could potentially highlight larger progressions in the Salem-Spencer set.
  """
  return (k ** 3) / (n ** 3)
```

This version of the function calculates the priority as the cube of `k` over the cube of `n`, which could potentially highlight larger progressions in the Salem-Spencer set. This is a small change from `priority_v0`, which used the square of `k` and `n`.
