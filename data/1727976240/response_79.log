Here's a simple improvement for `priority_v1` over `priority_v0`. I assume that larger numbers have higher priority. This function calculates the relative size of `k` compared to the total number of possible integers `n`.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  return k / n
```

This function will return a value between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates that `k` is the maximum possible integer and 0 indicates that `k` is 0. This assumes that `k` and `n` are both positive. If `k` and `n` could be negative or zero, additional checks would be necessary.
