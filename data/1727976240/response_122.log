It seems like you're working on a project that involves finding large progressions in the Salem-Spencer set. The code you've shared includes a function `priority_v0`, which calculates the priority with which we want to add a given integer `k` to the Salem-Spencer set. The function takes two arguments: `k`, the integer we want to determine priority for, and `n`, the total number of possible integers.

You've also mentioned that you've created improved versions of `priority_v0`, namely `priority_v1` and `priority_v2`. However, the code for these improved versions is missing.

I'd be happy to help you with the implementation of these functions based on the description you've provided. Could you please provide more details about the improvements you've made in `priority_v1` and `priority_v2` compared to `priority_v0`?
