In order to improve upon the `priority_v0` function, we need to consider the problem at hand. The function `priority_v0` currently returns a constant value of `0.0` for all integers `k` and a given `n`. This means that no integer has a higher priority than any other integer when it comes to being added to the Salem-Spencer set.

To improve this, we could consider the value of `k` itself. One simple way to do this is to return `k` as the priority. This would mean that larger integers have a higher priority than smaller integers. However, since `k` can be quite large, we might want to normalize this priority by dividing by `n`. This would give us a priority between `0` and `1` for each integer.

Here is how we might implement this:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`.
  Returns the priority of `k` as a float between 0 and 1.
  """
  return k / n
```

This version of the function now takes into account the value of `k` when determining priority, and it provides a normalized priority score.
