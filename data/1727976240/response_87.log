This function `priority_v2` is expected to be an improved version of `priority_v1`. However, without additional specifications or context, it's not possible to provide an accurate implementation of `priority_v2`.

If we assume that the priority is inversely proportional to `k`, then `priority_v2` could be written as:

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v1`.

  Returns a priority value that is inversely proportional to `k`, the integer for which priority is calculated.
  """
  return (n - k) / n
```

In this implementation, the priority of the smallest `k` is the highest, and the priority of the largest `k` is the lowest.

But without clearer guidelines or specific requirements, this is just an assumption. The actual implementation of `priority_v2` may vary based on the specific use case or problem statement.
