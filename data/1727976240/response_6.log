Sure, I'd be happy to help you improve your code. Here's a possible way to improve the `priority_v1` function based on the instructions provided. This version will prioritize larger numbers and those that divide the total number of possible integers more evenly:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  # Priority is higher for larger numbers
  size_priority = k / n

  # Priority is higher for numbers that divide n more evenly
  divisibility_priority = 1 / min(n % k, k - n % k)

  return size_priority * divisibility_priority
```

This function calculates the priority of a number `k` out of `n` possible integers. It considers two factors: the size of `k` relative to `n`, and how well `k` divides `n`. The priority is calculated as the product of these two factors. This way, larger numbers that divide `n` more evenly will have higher priority.
