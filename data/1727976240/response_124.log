To improve the `priority_v1` function, we can take into account the number of divisors of `k`. The more divisors `k` has, the higher its priority. This is because numbers with more divisors are likely to be part of larger progressions.

Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the number of divisors:

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the number of divisors."""
  # Calculate the number of divisors of k
  divisors = sum(k % i == 0 for i in range(1, k + 1))

  # Return the priority as the product of k/n and the number of divisors
  return (k / n) * divisors
```

This updated `priority_v2` function calculates the number of divisors of `k` and multiplies it with the result of `priority_v1` to get the final priority. This takes into account both the value of `k` and the number of divisors it has, providing a better measure of its likelihood of being part of a large Salem-Spencer progression.
