Based on your task, I have improved the `priority_v1` function over `priority_v0`. The `priority_v1` function now returns the reciprocal of the integer `k` divided by the total number of possible integers `n`. This change increases the priority of smaller integers, which could potentially lead to more efficient search results in the Salem-Spencer set. Here's the updated code:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  return 1.0 / (k / n)
```

As for the `priority_v2` function, I am not sure what specific improvements you are looking for. Could you please provide more context or specific requirements?
