It seems like there's a mistake in the last line of the code. The function `priority_v2` is defined but it doesn't have any code inside. I can't improve it without knowing what the intended functionality should be.

However, based on the improvements made in `priority_v0` and `priority_v1`, I can guess that `priority_v2` might calculate the priority as the ratio of the integer to the total number of possible integers, but with some additional considerations or modifications.

Without more context or specifications, it's difficult to provide a more accurate improvement. Could you please provide more details or clarify what you're trying to achieve with `priority_v2`?
