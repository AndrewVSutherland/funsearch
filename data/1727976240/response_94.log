To improve upon the `priority_v0` function, we can use the concept of prime numbers and their distribution to determine the priority of adding an integer to the Salem-Spencer set. The idea is to prioritize numbers that are less likely to be divisible by smaller prime numbers, as they are more likely to be part of an arithmetic progression.

Here's an improved version of the `priority_v1` function:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`.
    n is the number of possible integers, and k is the integer we want to determine priority for.
    """
    # Check if k is a prime number
    if is_prime(k):
        # Prioritize prime numbers
        return 1.0
    else:
        # Calculate the number of prime factors of k
        num_prime_factors = len(prime_factors(k))
        # Prioritize numbers with fewer prime factors
        return 1.0 / num_prime_factors

def is_prime(num: int) -> bool:
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(np.sqrt(num)) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def prime_factors(num: int) -> list:
    """Find all prime factors of a number."""
    factors = []
    while num % 2 == 0:
        factors.append(2)
        num = num // 2
    for i in range(3, int(np.sqrt(num)) + 1, 2):
        while num % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            num = num // i
    if num > 2:
        factors.append(num)
    return factors
```

In this version, we first check if the number is prime. If it is, we give it the highest priority (1.0) because prime numbers are less likely to be divisible by smaller numbers and are therefore more likely to be part of an arithmetic progression. If the number is not prime, we calculate the number of its prime factors and prioritize it based on the reciprocal of the number of prime factors. This way, numbers with fewer prime factors (i.e., numbers that are less composite) are given higher priority.
