It seems there's a mistake in the last line of the code. The function `priority_v1` is not implemented. I will implement it now.

The function `priority_v1`, given an integer `k` and the total number of possible integers `n`, calculates and returns a priority value for `k`. The priority is calculated as the absolute difference between `k` and `n//2`, divided by `n`. This prioritizes the integers that are closest to the middle of the range.

Let's write and execute this code.
```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  \"\"\"Improved version of `priority_v0`.\"\"\"
  return abs(k - n//2) / n

# Test the function with some values
print(priority_v1(5, 10))
print(priority_v1(8, 10))
```
