To improve the `priority_v1` function over the `priority_v0` function, we need to consider the characteristics of the Salem-Spencer set and the integer `k` we want to determine the priority for.

The Salem-Spencer set is a collection of integers that have certain properties related to prime numbers and number theory. The priority function determines the order in which we add integers to the Salem-Spencer set.

In the `priority_v0` function, the priority is set to 0.0 for all integers `k`. This means that all integers have the same priority and there is no preference for any particular integer.

To improve the `priority_v1` function, we can consider the following modifications:

1. Frequency of prime factors: We can calculate the frequency of prime factors for each integer `k` and use it as a priority metric. Integers with more unique prime factors or integers with prime factors that appear less frequently can be given a higher priority.

2. Prime gap: We can calculate the difference between consecutive prime numbers for each integer `k` and use it as a priority metric. Integers with larger prime gaps can be given a higher priority as they are less likely to be divisible by small prime numbers.

3. Number of divisors: We can calculate the number of divisors for each integer `k` and use it as a priority metric. Integers with fewer divisors can be given a higher priority as they are less likely to be divisible by multiple numbers.

Here's an example implementation of the `priority_v1` function that uses the frequency of prime factors as the priority metric:

```python
import math
from collections import Counter

def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""

    # Function to find prime factors of a number
    def prime_factors(n):
        i = 2
        factors = []
        while i * i <= n:
            if n % i:
                i += 1
            else:
                n //= i
                factors.append(i)
        if n > 1:
            factors.append(n)
        return factors

    # Calculate the frequency of prime factors for integer k
    prime_factors_freq = Counter(prime_factors(k))

    # Calculate the priority based on the frequency of prime factors
    priority = sum(1 / freq for freq in prime_factors_freq.values())

    return priority
```

In this implementation, the `prime_factors` function is used to find all the prime factors of the integer `k`. The `Counter` class from the `collections` module is used to count the frequency of each prime factor. The priority is then calculated as the sum of the reciprocals of the frequencies of the prime factors.

This implementation gives a higher priority to integers with more unique prime factors or integers with prime factors that appear less frequently. This can help in finding large progressions in the Salem-Spencer set.
