The priority_v1 function can be improved by implementing the same formula as in priority_v0. This is because the formula in priority_v0 is a more sophisticated way of determining the priority of adding an integer to the Salem-Spencer set, and it seems to be more effective than simply returning 0.0 for all cases.

Here is the improved version of the priority_v1 function:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  return k / (n * np.log(n) ** np.sqrt(np.log(n)))
```

This function now returns a float value that is calculated using the same formula as in priority_v0. This should result in more accurate and meaningful priority values for the Salem-Spencer set.
