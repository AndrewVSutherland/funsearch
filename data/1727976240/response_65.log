Sure, here's a simple improvement to the `priority_v1` function. This version assigns a higher priority to larger numbers, as they are more likely to contribute to a large SS progression.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`. Assigns a higher priority to larger numbers."""
  return k / n
```

In this version, the priority is determined by the ratio of the integer `k` to the total number of possible integers `n`. This way, larger numbers receive a higher priority.
