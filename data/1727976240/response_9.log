It seems like there's a missing part of the code related to the Salem-Spencer set and how the priority of adding an integer to this set is determined. However, based on the description, I can make some assumptions and provide a possible implementation for the `priority_v1` function.

The function `priority_v1` takes two arguments: `k`, an integer we want to evaluate, and `n`, the total number of possible integers. The function should return a float representing the priority with which we want to add `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.

A possible way to improve the `priority_v0` function is to consider the relationship between `k` and `n`. One possibility could be to return a higher priority for smaller `k` values compared to larger ones, as smaller integers may lead to larger progressions. Additionally, we can also consider the ratio of `k` to `n` to determine the priority.

Here's a possible implementation for `priority_v1`:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  return 1 - (k / n)
```

In this implementation, the priority is determined by subtracting the ratio of `k` to `n` from 1. This means that smaller `k` values will result in a higher priority, since they contribute more to the ratio.
