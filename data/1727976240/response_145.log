It seems that there was a mistake in the last line of the code. The function `priority_v2` is not defined. I will define it now based on the context of the previous functions.

The `priority_v2` function should be an improved version of `priority_v1`. Given that `priority_v1` is also an improved version of `priority_v0`, it's reasonable to assume that `priority_v2` would incorporate the improvements from both `priority_v0` and `priority_v1`.

Here's a possible implementation:

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v1`."""
  # If k is divisible by the next smaller number than n, it has a higher priority
  if k % (n - 1) == 0:
    base_priority = 1.0
  else:
    base_priority = 0.0

  # Numbers with more divisors have a higher priority
  num_divisors = sum(1 for i in range(1, k + 1) if k % i == 0)
  divisor_priority = num_divisors / k

  # Larger numbers have a higher priority
  size_priority = k / n

  return base_priority + divisor_priority + size_priority
```

In this version, I've added a new priority component, `size_priority`, which is the same as in `priority_v1`. I've also kept the divisor priority component and the base priority component from `priority_v0`. This way, we consider the number of divisors, its size relative to `n`, and whether it's divisible by `n - 1`.
