Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the number of unique remainders when dividing `k` by `n` and the number of multiples of `k` within the range `[0, n)`. This version is shorter and makes small changes to the original function.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  remainders = set(k % i for i in range(1, n + 1))
  multiples = sum(i // k for i in range(k, n + 1))
  return len(remainders) + multiples
```

This version first calculates the set of unique remainders when dividing `k` by all integers from 1 to `n`. Then, it counts the number of multiples of `k` within the range `[k, n]`. The priority is the sum of the number of unique remainders and multiples of `k`.
