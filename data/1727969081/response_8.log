Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[0, n)` and the number of remaining elements. The improvement is made by adding a small change to the priority calculation, making the code short as requested.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  freq = sum(1 for i in range(n) if i % k == 0)  # Frequency of k in [0, n)
  remaining = n - k  # Number of remaining elements
  return freq / (remaining + 1)  # Small change: add 1 to the denominator
```

This version of `priority_v1` gives more priority to numbers with higher frequencies and less priority to numbers with fewer remaining elements. The addition of 1 to the denominator is a small change that prevents division by zero when `remaining` is zero.
