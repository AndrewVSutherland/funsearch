Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the number of elements less than `k` and the total number of possible integers `n`. This version uses the formula `priority = (n - k) / (n * np.log(n))` to calculate the priority.

```python
import numpy as np

def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
    return (n - k) / (n * np.log(n))
```

This version of `priority_v1` makes a small change from `priority_v0` by considering the number of elements less than `k` and using a formula that incorporates `n` and `np.log(n)`. The code is also shorter than the original `priority_v0` function.
