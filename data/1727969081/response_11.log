Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the number of unique remainders when dividing `k` by `n`. This version is shorter and makes a small change from `priority_v0`.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  return len(set(k % i for i in range(1, n + 1)))
```

This version calculates the priority as the number of unique remainders when dividing `k` by all integers from 1 to `n`. This is a simple improvement that considers the diversity of remainders, which is a relevant factor in Salem-Spencer sets.
