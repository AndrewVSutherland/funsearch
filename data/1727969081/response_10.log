Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[0, n)` and the number of missing integers in that range. This version uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequencies.

```python
from collections import Counter

def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  # Count the frequency of each integer in the range [0, n)
  freq = Counter(range(n))

  # Calculate the number of missing integers in the range [0, k)
  missing = sum(i < k for i in range(n))

  # Return a priority score based on frequency and missing integers
  return freq[k] / n + missing / n
```

This version of `priority_v1` makes a small change by considering the frequency of `k` and the number of missing integers in the range `[0, k)`. The priority score is calculated as the sum of the normalized frequency and the normalized number of missing integers. This should improve the priority calculation compared to `priority_v0`.
