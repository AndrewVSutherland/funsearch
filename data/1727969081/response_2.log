Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]` and the number of missing integers in that range. This version is shorter and makes small changes to `priority_v0`.

```python
from collections import Counter

@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
    # Count the frequency of k in the range [1, n]
    freq = sum(1 for i in range(1, n + 1) if i % k == 0)

    # Count the number of missing integers in the range [1, n]
    missing = n - freq

    # Return the priority as the ratio of missing integers to frequency
    return missing / freq if freq > 0 else 0.0
```

This version of `priority_v1` assumes that you want to prioritize adding integers that are less frequent in the range `[1, n]` and have more missing integers in their multiples. The priority is calculated as the ratio of missing integers to frequency, with a default value of 0.0 if the frequency is 0.
