Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in all possible subsets of size `k` in the range `[1, n]`. This version uses the `itertools.combinations` function to generate all possible subsets and counts the occurrences of `k` in each subset.

```python
import itertools

def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  count = sum(k in subset for r in range(1, k + 1) for subset in itertools.combinations(range(1, n + 1), r))
  return count / (n ** k)
```

This version makes a small change by introducing a simple frequency count of `k` in subsets of size `k`. The priority is then calculated as the ratio of this count to the total number of possible combinations of size `k` from `n` elements.

To further improve this function, you could consider additional factors such as the distance of `k` from the mean of its subset or the diversity of values in the subset. However, keep in mind the constraint to make only small changes and keep the code short.

Here's a slightly more complex version that considers the mean and standard deviation of each subset:

```python
import itertools
import statistics

def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Further improved version of `priority_v1`."""
  count = sum(k in subset for r in range(1, k + 1) for subset in itertools.combinations(range(1, n + 1), r))
  means = [statistics.mean(subset) for r in range(1, k + 1) for subset in itertools.combinations(range(1, n + 1), r)]
  stdevs = [statistics.stdev(subset) for r in range(1, k + 1) for subset in itertools.combinations(range(1, n + 1), r)]

  priority = count / (n ** k) * (1 + (k - means) / stdevs)
  return priority
```

In this version, we calculate the mean and standard deviation of each subset and use them to adjust the priority based on how close `k` is to the mean and how diverse the values in the subset are.
