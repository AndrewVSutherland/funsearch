It seems like you're looking to find large sequences of Salem-Spencer numbers, and you're trying to improve a priority function that determines the order in which you add numbers to the set.

You've started with a basic `priority_v0` function that always returns 0.0, which means that the order of addition doesn't matter.

In `priority_v1`, you're aiming to improve this function. However, the code for `priority_v1` is missing.

Assuming that you want to prioritize numbers that have more potential to form a large Salem-Spencer sequence, a simple improvement could be to prioritize numbers with fewer remaining divisors. Here's a possible implementation:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  divisors = sum(1 for i in range(1, k + 1) if k % i == 0)
  return n / divisors
```

This function calculates the number of divisors of `k` and uses this to determine the priority. Numbers with fewer divisors are given a higher priority, as they have more potential to be part of a larger Salem-Spencer sequence.

However, this is a very basic improvement and there are many possible ways to define the priority. The best choice depends on your specific requirements and constraints.
