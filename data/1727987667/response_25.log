To improve the `priority_v1` function over the `priority_v0` method, we need to consider the value of `k` and `n` to determine the priority of adding an element to the Salem-Spencer set. We can modify the function to calculate a score based on these values and return that score as the priority.

Here's an improved version of the `priority_v1` function:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
    # Calculate the score based on k and n
    score = k / n

    # Return the priority as the score
    return score
```

In this improved version, the score is calculated as the ratio of `k` to `n`. This means that larger values of `k` relative to `n` will result in a higher score and thus a higher priority.

You can use this function to determine the priority of adding an element to the Salem-Spencer set based on the given `k` and `n` values.
