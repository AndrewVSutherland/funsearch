The problem is about finding an optimal way to select and add integers to a Salem-Spencer set. The function `priority_v1` is supposed to improve upon the `priority_v0` function by making small changes to the code. The function should return a priority value for a given integer `k` out of a range of `n` possible integers. The priority value should be a float between 0 and 1, with higher values indicating a higher priority for adding the integer to the set.

Here's how I would improve the `priority_v0` function to create `priority_v1`:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
    # Normalize k to the range [-1, 1]
    normalized_k = 2 * k / n - 1

    # Use a tanh function to prioritize numbers closer to the center of the range
    return np.tanh(3 * normalized_k)
```

In `priority_v1`, I've made a few small changes to the `priority_v0` function. First, I've adjusted the normalization of `k` to better center the range on 0. Next, I've replaced the sigmoid function with a tanh function, which has a steeper slope and a higher midpoint, making it better suited to prioritize numbers closer to the center of the range. The hyperparameter 3 in the tanh function can be adjusted to control the slope of the function.
