I have improved the `priority_v1` function to return the priority with which we want to add an integer `k` to the Salem-Spencer set. The priority is calculated based on the size of the gap between `k` and the largest integer currently in the set, divided by the total number of possible integers `n`. This way, integers that increase the gap between elements in the set have a higher priority.

Here is the improved `priority_v1` function:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int, salem_spencer_set: set) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  if not salem_spencer_set:
    return 1.0
  max_in_set = max(salem_spencer_set)
  gap = k - max_in_set
  return gap / n
```

In this function, `salem_spencer_set` is an additional parameter that represents the current Salem-Spencer set. This set is used to determine the gap between `k` and the largest integer currently in the set. If the set is empty, the function returns 1.0 as the priority, indicating that `k` should be added to the set.
