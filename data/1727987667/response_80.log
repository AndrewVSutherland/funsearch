It seems like there's a misunderstanding in your request. The `priority_v0` and `priority_v1` functions are exactly the same, which means there's no improvement from `priority_v0` to `priority_v1`.

However, I can suggest an improvement to `priority_v1` (or `priority_v0` since they're the same) which could be more suitable depending on the context. The current function returns a simple ratio of `k` to `n`, which might not be the most effective metric for determining priority.

A possible improvement could be to use a logarithmic scale, which can help to differentiate between large and small values of `k` and `n`. This could be done by modifying the function to return `log(k) / log(n)` instead of `k / n`.

Here's how you could implement this:

```python
import math

def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v1` using logarithmic scale."""
  return math.log(k) / math.log(n)
```

This function will return values between 0 and 1, similar to the original function, but it will give more weight to larger values of `k` relative to `n`.
