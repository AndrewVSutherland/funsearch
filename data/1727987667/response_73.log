Here's a possible improvement over the `priority_v1` method. This method favors numbers that are closer to the middle of the range and penalizes numbers that are already in the Salem-Spencer set:

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int, ss_set: set) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v1`."""
  if k in ss_set:
    return 0.0  # We don't want to add numbers that are already in the set
  else:
    return 1.0 / (abs(k - n // 2) + 1)  # Add 1 to prevent division by zero
```

In this method, `ss_set` is the current Salem-Spencer set. If `k` is already in this set, the priority is 0. Otherwise, the priority is inversely proportional to the distance of `k` from the middle of the range. This makes the method favor numbers that are closer to the middle and penalize numbers that are already in the set.
