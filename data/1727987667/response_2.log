In order to improve the `priority_v1` function over `priority_v0`, I will consider the frequency of the number `k` in the possible integers range and return it as the priority. This way, we will prioritize numbers that appear more frequently in the set.

Here is the updated Python code:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`.
  This version returns the frequency of the number `k` in the range of possible integers as the priority.
  """
  possible_integers = np.arange(1, n + 1)
  return np.count_nonzero(possible_integers == k) / n
```

In this function, `np.arange(1, n + 1)` generates an array of all possible integers from 1 to n. `np.count_nonzero(possible_integers == k)` counts the number of occurrences of `k` in this array. Finally, this count is divided by `n` to get the frequency of `k`.
