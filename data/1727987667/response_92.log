The next step could be to consider the frequency of each integer in the range. If an integer appears more frequently, it might be more valuable to include in the Salem-Spencer set. This could be implemented by calculating the frequency of each integer and using it as a multiplier for the priority score. Here's a possible implementation of `priority_v2`:

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int, data: list) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v1`."""
  frequency = data.count(k) / len(data)
  return frequency * k / n
```

In this version, `data` is a list of integers that will be used to calculate the frequency of each integer. The frequency is then multiplied by the score from `priority_v1` to give the final priority score.
