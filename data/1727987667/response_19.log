The `priority_v1` function is an enhanced version of `priority_v0` that aims to improve the priority calculation for adding an integer `k` to the Salem-Spencer set. The Salem-Spencer set is a subset of integers that exhibit strong unique factorization properties. The priority function determines the order in which integers are considered for addition to the set, and a higher priority value indicates a stronger reason for inclusion.

Without specific requirements or constraints for the improvement, it's challenging to provide a meaningful enhancement to `priority_v0`, which simply returns 0.0 for all inputs.

One possible approach might be to assign priority based on the number of unique prime factors that `k` has, as integers with more unique prime factors are more likely to contribute to the unique factorization properties of the Salem-Spencer set. However, without more context or specific criteria, it's difficult to suggest a more precise implementation.

Here's a simple example of how `priority_v1` might be implemented using this approach:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  def prime_factors(n):
    i = 2
    factors = []
    while i * i <= n:
      if n % i:
        i += 1
      else:
        n //= i
        factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
      factors.append(n)
    return factors

  unique_factors = set(prime_factors(k))
  return len(unique_factors) / n  # Normalize priority by dividing by the total number of possible integers
```

In this implementation, `prime_factors` is a helper function that calculates the prime factors of an integer `n`. The `priority_v1` function then calculates the number of unique prime factors of `k` and normalizes this value by dividing by the total number of possible integers `n`, to ensure that the priority value is within the range [0, 1].
