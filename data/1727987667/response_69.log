It seems like your code is a work-in-progress, and you're looking to improve upon version 0 and 1 of the priority function. However, the function `priority_v1` is not defined in the code provided.

Given the context of the problem, I'll assume that the priority function is intended to assign a priority score to an integer `k` based on certain criteria. The higher the score, the higher the priority of adding `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.

Given that `n` is the number of possible integers, a simple improvement to `priority_v0` could be to give higher priority to larger integers. This could be done by returning `k / n` as the priority, which scales the integer value to a range between 0 and 1. This way, larger integers will receive a higher priority score.

Here's the improved `priority_v1` function:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  return k / n
```

However, I need more context to provide a meaningful improvement for `priority_v2`. Could you please provide more details or clarify the specific criteria for the priority score?
