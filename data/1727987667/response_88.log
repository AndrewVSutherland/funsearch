The provided code defines a function `priority_v0` that always returns 0.0. This function takes two arguments, `k` and `n`, where `k` is the integer for which we want to determine the priority, and `n` is the total number of possible integers.

The task is to improve this function by creating a new version, `priority_v1`, that considers `k` and `n` to compute a priority value. The goal is to make small changes to the code while focusing on its simplicity and effectiveness.

Since the original code doesn't provide any context or requirements for the priority calculation, we can't make a specific improvement. However, we can assume a simple priority calculation based on the ratio of `k` to `n`, where a larger ratio indicates a higher priority. Here's an example of how `priority_v1` could be implemented:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  return k / n
```

In this implementation, the priority is calculated as the ratio of `k` to `n`, which gives a value between 0 and 1. A larger `k` relative to `n` will result in a higher priority.

Note that this is a simple example, and the actual priority calculation may vary depending on the specific problem or requirements.
