The problem is about finding large progressions in the Salem-Spencer set. The Salem-Spencer set is a subset of integers that have certain properties related to their prime factorization. The task is to improve a priority function that determines the order in which to add integers to the set. The priority function should take two arguments: the integer to be added and the number of possible integers.

Here's a possible solution for `priority_v1`:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  # Calculate the number of unique prime factors of k
  unique_factors = len(set(funsearch.prime_factors(k)))

  # Normalize the number of unique factors by dividing by the largest possible number of factors
  normalized_factors = unique_factors / np.sqrt(k)

  # Calculate the priority as the inverse of the normalized number of factors
  priority = 1 / (1 + normalized_factors)

  return priority
```

This solution calculates the priority based on the number of unique prime factors of the integer `k`. The more unique factors an integer has, the lower its priority. This is because integers with more unique factors are less likely to be part of a large progression in the Salem-Spencer set. The priority is calculated as the inverse of the normalized number of factors, where the normalization is done by dividing by the square root of `k`. This ensures that the priority is always between 0 and 1, and that integers with fewer factors have a higher priority.
