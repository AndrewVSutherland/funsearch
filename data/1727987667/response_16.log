The function `priority_v1` is an improved version of the `priority_v0` function. However, the provided code only includes the function signature and a docstring, but there is no implementation of the function body.

To improve the `priority_v0` function, we can modify the priority calculation to consider the difference between `k` and `n` and the square root of `n`. This will give more weight to larger `k` values and smaller `n` values.

Here's the improved version of the `priority_v1` function:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  # Return the priority as the ratio of (k - n/2) to the square root of n
  return (k - n/2) / np.sqrt(n)
```

In this version, we subtract `n/2` from `k` to give more weight to larger `k` values. We also divide the result by the square root of `n` to normalize the priority value. This will make the priorities more comparable when `n` changes.
