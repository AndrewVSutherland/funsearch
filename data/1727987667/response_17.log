Sure, here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the difference between `k` and `n`, and the square of `k`:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  # Prioritize larger difference between k and n
  diff = abs(k - n)
  # Prioritize smaller values of k
  small_k = 1 / (k + 1)
  # Prioritize squares of k to give more weight to larger k values
  square_k = k ** 2
  # Return the priority as a combination of the above factors
  return diff * small_k * square_k
```

This version of the function prioritizes larger differences between `k` and `n`, smaller values of `k`, and larger values of `k`. The product of these factors is returned as the priority.
