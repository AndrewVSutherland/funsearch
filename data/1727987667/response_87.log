It seems like you're working on a project that involves finding large Salem-Spencer progressions. The function `priority_v0` is defined to return the priority with which we want to add a certain integer to the Salem-Spencer set. This priority is calculated as the logarithm of the ratio of `k + 1` to `n + 1`.

The function `priority_v1` is an improved version of `priority_v0`, but it currently returns 0.0 for all inputs. You mentioned that you want to improve `priority_v1` over `priority_v0`, but I need more specific instructions on how to do that.

As for `priority_v2`, it's currently undefined. If you have any specific improvements or modifications in mind for this function, please let me know.
