Here's an improved version of `priority_v0` that considers the frequency of the divisors of `k`. The more frequent the divisors, the higher the priority.

```python
def divisors(n):
    result = []
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            if n // i == i:
                result.append(i)
            else:
                result.extend([i, n // i])
    return result

def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`.
    Consider the frequency of divisors of `k`.
    """
    divs = divisors(k)
    freq = np.bincount(divs)
    return np.sum(freq**2) / len(divs)
```

This version counts the frequency of each divisor and then sums the squares of these frequencies. This is divided by the total number of divisors to normalize the result. The squared frequency is used to give more weight to divisors with higher frequencies.

The `divisors` function is a helper function that returns a list of all divisors of a number. It does this by checking all numbers up to the square root of the input number and checking if they are a divisor. If a number is a divisor, both the number and the quotient are added to the list of divisors.

This approach gives a higher priority to numbers with more frequent divisors, which could potentially lead to larger progressions in the Salem-Spencer set.
