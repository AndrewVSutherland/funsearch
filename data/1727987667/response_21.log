Here's a possible improvement to `priority_v1`:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  # Give higher priority to larger numbers
  return k / n
```

This version gives higher priority to larger numbers, as they contribute more to the sum of the Salem-Spencer set. This might lead to finding larger progressions more quickly.
