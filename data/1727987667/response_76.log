It seems like there's a small mistake in the code comments. The comment for `priority_v2` is the same as `priority_v1`. I will fix it for you.

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v1`. This version might consider the remaining elements in the set."""
  # For example, we could prioritize elements that are closer to the average of the remaining elements
  # or that have a higher product with the remaining elements.
  # The actual implementation would depend on the specific problem at hand.
  # Here, for the sake of an example, we'll just square the ratio of k to n.
  return (k / n) ** 2
```

This is just a placeholder for how you might improve the priority function. The actual improvement would depend on the specifics of your problem.
