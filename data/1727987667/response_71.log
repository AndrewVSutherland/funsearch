Based on the function `priority_v0`, which calculates the priority of an integer `k` to be added to the Salem-Spencer set with a total of `n` possible integers, I'd propose a small modification for `priority_v1`. The updated function would consider the difference between `k` and the midpoint of the range of possible integers. By doing this, we prioritize integers that are closer to the middle, assuming that larger numbers are more likely to be part of a large SS progression.

Here's how `priority_v1` could be implemented:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  midpoint = n / 2
  return 1 - abs(k - midpoint) / midpoint
```

In this updated version, the priority is calculated as `1` minus the absolute difference between `k` and the midpoint, normalized by the midpoint. This way, integers closer to the midpoint receive higher priority.

The next step would be to improve this function further for `priority_v2`, but without more context or specific requirements, it's difficult to suggest a more precise modification.
