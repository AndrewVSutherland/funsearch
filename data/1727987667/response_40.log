Here's the next version of the `priority_v2` function. This version improves on `priority_v1` by adding a small constant to the denominator of the fraction to avoid division by zero when `n` is very small.

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v1`."""
  # Add a small constant to the denominator to avoid division by zero
  return (k - n/2) / np.sqrt(n + 1e-6)
```

In this version, we add `1e-6` to `n` inside the square root to make sure we don't try to compute the square root of zero or a negative number, which would result in a `ValueError`. The value `1e-6` is chosen arbitrarily as a small number, and it can be adjusted if necessary.
