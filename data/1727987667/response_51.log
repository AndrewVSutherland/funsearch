Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the distance of `k` from the midpoint of the range of possible integers. This might be more appropriate for a problem where larger numbers are considered more important than smaller numbers, and the middle of the range is the most important.

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v1`. Considers the distance of `k` from the midpoint."""
  midpoint = n / 2
  return 1 - abs(k - midpoint) / midpoint
```

In this version, the priority is inversely proportional to the distance of `k` from the midpoint. The closer `k` is to the midpoint, the higher its priority.
