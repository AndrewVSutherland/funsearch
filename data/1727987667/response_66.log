Let's define the priority of an integer k in the Salem-Spencer set based on its contribution to the progression of sums of its multiples. The idea is to prioritize integers that contribute significantly to the increase in the sum of multiples, as these will likely result in larger progressions.

We can define the priority as the average increase in the sum of multiples that adding k to the set would cause. This can be calculated as the sum of k times all the numbers in the set, divided by the number of elements in the set.

Here's a possible implementation:

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int, salem_spencer_set: set) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v1`.
  n is the number of possible integers, and k is the integer we want to determine priority for.
  salem_spencer_set is the current Salem-Spencer set.
  """
  if not salem_spencer_set:
    return 0.0
  else:
    return sum(k * i for i in salem_spencer_set) / len(salem_spencer_set)
```

In this version, we also take into account the current Salem-Spencer set, which allows us to calculate the priority of k based on its effect on the set as a whole. If the set is empty, we return 0.0, since k would be the first element and therefore wouldn't have any effect on the sum of multiples.

This priority function prioritizes integers that would cause a larger increase in the sum of multiples, as these are more likely to result in large progressions.
