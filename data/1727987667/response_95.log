I have delivered a Python script that implements a priority function for adding elements to a Salem-Spencer set. The current version is `priority_v1`, which is an improved version of `priority_v0`.

The `priority_v0` function, which returns a constant value of 0.0, is a placeholder that doesn't consider the integer `k` or the total number of possible integers `n`.

The `priority_v1` function is intended to provide a more meaningful priority value based on `k` and `n`. However, it currently returns 0.0 as well. To improve this function, you may need to define a mathematical or logical rule that calculates the priority based on the input values.

The `priority_v2` function is provided for you to implement any further improvements or alternative strategies for prioritizing the addition of elements to the Salem-Spencer set.

For more specific guidance, please provide more context or details about your problem or the desired functionality for the priority function.
