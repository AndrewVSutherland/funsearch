Here's an improved version of `priority_v1`:

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v1`.

  Priority is given based on the difference between k and the midpoint of the range [1, n].
  A higher priority is given to numbers closer to the midpoint.
  """
  midpoint = n // 2
  return 1.0 - abs(k - midpoint) / midpoint
```

This version of the function calculates the absolute difference between `k` and the midpoint of the range of possible integers, then divides that by the midpoint. This gives a number between 0 and 1, with 1 being the highest priority (closest to the midpoint) and 0 being the lowest priority (farthest from the midpoint).
