This is a complex problem that involves searching for large SS progressions in a set of integers. The function `priority_v1` is intended to be an improvement over `priority_v0`, which is a placeholder function that currently returns 0.0 for all inputs.

Without more specific information about the context or the specific requirements of the problem, it's difficult to provide a more concrete solution. However, a general approach could be to use the concept of SS progressions, which are sets of integers with certain mathematical properties. A possible improvement over `priority_v0` could be to calculate the length of the longest SS progression that can be formed using the integers from 1 to `k`, and return this value as the priority. This would require implementing an algorithm to find SS progressions efficiently.

Here's a simple example of how `priority_v1` might be implemented:

```python
def ss_progression_length(k: int) -> int:
    """Returns the length of the longest SS progression among the integers from 1 to k."""
    # This is a placeholder implementation. A real implementation would involve more complex mathematics.
    return k // 2

def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`. Returns the length of the longest SS progression among the integers from 1 to k."""
    return float(ss_progression_length(k))
```

In this example, `ss_progression_length` is a placeholder function that simply returns `k // 2`. In a real implementation, this function would need to be replaced with an algorithm that can efficiently find the length of the longest SS progression among the integers from 1 to `k`. The `priority_v1` function then converts this length to a float and returns it as the priority.
