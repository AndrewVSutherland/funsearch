Improved version of `priority_v0`:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Returns the priority with which we want to add `k` to the salem-spencer set.
  n is the number of possible integers, and k is the integer we want to determine priority for.
  """
  # The priority is inversely proportional to the number of multiples of k that are smaller than n
  # This is because the more multiples of k there are, the easier it is to find a large progression
  return n / (n // k)
```

This function calculates the priority of a number `k` to be added to the Salem-Spencer set. The priority is defined as the ratio of `n` (the total number of possible integers) to the largest multiple of `k` that is less than `n`. This is because the larger this ratio, the more likely it is that `k` will contribute to the formation of a large progression.
