Sure, I can help with that. The function `priority_v1` is an improved version of `priority_v0`.

Given the problem statement, I will assume that the priority is related to the size of the integer `k`. A simple way to improve `priority_v0` could be to return the value of `k` as the priority. This way, larger integers will have a higher priority.

Here's the updated function:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`. Returns the priority based on the size of the integer `k`."""
  return float(k)
```

This function will prioritize larger integers over smaller ones when adding elements to the Salem-Spencer set.
