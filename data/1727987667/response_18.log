Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that takes into account the distance of the integer `k` from the middle of the range of possible integers (from 0 to `n-1`). The further `k` is from the middle, the higher its priority.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  middle = n // 2
  return 1.0 - abs(k - middle) / middle
```

This function returns a priority between 0 and 1, where 1 is the highest priority. The priority is calculated as 1 minus the absolute difference between `k` and the middle of the range, divided by the middle of the range. This means that integers closer to the middle of the range have a lower priority, while integers further away have a higher priority.
