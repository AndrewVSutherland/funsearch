    max_ss = max(ss)
    if k > max_ss:  # If k is greater than the maximum element in ss, it has a higher priority.
        return 1.0 / (k - max_ss)

    # If k is smaller than all elements in ss, it has a lower priority.
    if k < min(ss):
        return 1.0 / (min(ss) - k)

    # If k is in between the elements in ss, calculate the gap between k and the nearest elements in ss.
    gap_below = min(abs(k - i) for i in ss if i < k)
    gap_above = min(abs(k - i) for i in ss if i > k)

```
In this version, the priority is influenced by both the current state of the Salem-Spencer set and the potential progression. This implementation considers three cases: when the set is empty, when the integer is greater than the maximum element in the set, and when the integer is smaller than the minimum element. In all other cases, it calculates the gap between the integer and the nearest elements in the set, and the priority is the inverse of the smaller gap. This approach encourages the addition of integers that can form larger progressions with the existing elements in the set.
