The problem focuses on finding large progressions in a Salem-Spencer set. A Salem-Spencer set is a set of integers that have certain properties related to prime numbers. The goal is to define a priority function that determines the order in which integers should be added to the set.

The current code defines three priority functions: `priority_v0`, `priority_v1`, and `priority_v2`. Each function takes two arguments: `k` and `n`, where `k` is the integer for which the priority is being calculated and `n` is the total number of possible integers.

The current implementation of `priority_v0` and `priority_v1` is the same, as it always returns `0.0`. To improve these functions, the idea is to incorporate the values of `k` and `n` into the calculation of the priority.

Here's an example of how `priority_v2` could be improved by using the difference between `k` and `n` as a factor in the priority calculation:

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v1`."""
  return float(n - k) / n  # Priority is inversely proportional to the difference between n and k
```

This new version of `priority_v2` calculates the priority as the ratio of the difference between `n` and `k` to `n`. The priority will be higher for smaller values of `k` and lower for larger values of `k`, which means that smaller integers will be added to the set first.

However, the improvement in `priority_v2` is just an example, and the actual implementation could depend on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem.
