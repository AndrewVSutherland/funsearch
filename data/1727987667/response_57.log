Here's an improved version of `priority_v1`:

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v1`.

  Instead of just the ratio, we use the logarithm of the ratio.
  This gives more weight to larger ratios, which makes sense as we're interested in large progressions.
  """
  return np.log(k + 1) / np.log(n + 1)
```

This version of the function gives more emphasis to larger numbers, as it takes the logarithm of the ratio of `k` to `n`. This makes sense because we're interested in finding large progressions.
