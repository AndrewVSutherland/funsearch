To improve upon the previous implementation of the `priority_v0` function, I will take into account the value of `k` and the total number of possible integers `n`. A simple improvement could involve assigning higher priorities to larger values of `k`, as they contribute more to the Salem-Spencer set. Additionally, I'll consider the proportion of `k` to `n` to determine the priority, giving higher weight to larger `k` values that are closer to `n`. Here's the improved `priority_v1` function:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  # Return the priority as the ratio of k to n
  return k / n
```

This function will assign a priority of 0 to any `k` value of 0 and a priority of 1 to any `k` value equal to `n`. All other `k` values will receive a priority proportional to their value relative to `n`.
