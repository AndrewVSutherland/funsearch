Here's an improved version of `priority_v0` that considers the number of divisors of `k` and `n` in the calculation of priority.

```python
import numpy as np

def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  # Number of divisors of k
  div_k = sum(1 for i in range(1, k + 1) if k % i == 0)

  # Number of divisors of n
  div_n = sum(1 for i in range(1, n + 1) if n % i == 0)

  # Priority is proportional to the number of divisors of k and inversely proportional to the number of divisors of n
  return div_k / div_n
```

This version of the priority function will give higher priority to numbers that have more divisors, as these numbers are more likely to be part of a SS progression. At the same time, it will give lower priority to numbers that have many divisors, as these numbers are less likely to be the starting point of a large SS progression.
