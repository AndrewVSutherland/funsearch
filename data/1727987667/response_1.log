Here's an improved version of `priority_v0`:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Returns the priority that we want to add `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.
  `n` is the number of possible integers, and `k` is the integer for which we want to determine the priority.
  """
  # The priority is the ratio of the product of the two largest numbers less than k
  # to the total number of possible pairs (n^2), where n is the total number of possible integers.

  if k < 2:
    return 0.0

  largest_numbers = sorted([i for i in range(1, k)], reverse=True)[:2]
  priority = np.prod(largest_numbers) / (n ** 2)

  return priority
```

In this version, the priority is defined as the ratio of the product of the two largest numbers less than `k` to the total number of possible pairs (`n^2`). This is a simple way to ensure that larger numbers have a higher priority.

Please note that this function assumes that `n` is the total number of possible integers, not the current size of the Salem-Spencer set. If `n` is the size of the Salem-Spencer set, then the function should be modified accordingly.
