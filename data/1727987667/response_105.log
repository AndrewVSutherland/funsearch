The `priority_v2` function is not defined in the provided code. However, we can see that the `priority_v1` function is an improved version of `priority_v0`. Both these functions calculate the frequency of the remainder `k-1` when each number from 1 to `n` is divided by `k`, and return this frequency as the priority.

To further improve `priority_v1`, we can make the function more efficient by avoiding the use of `np.bincount` and `np.arange`. We can calculate the frequency of `k-1` by dividing `k-1` by `k` since `k-1` occurs `n // k` times in the range `1` to `n`. Here is the improved version of `priority_v1`:

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v1`."""
  return (n // k) / n
```

This version of the function has the same output as `priority_v1` but is more efficient since it avoids the use of NumPy functions.
