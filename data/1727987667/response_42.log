It seems like you're working on a function to determine the priority of adding an integer to a Salem-Spencer set. This function should take two arguments: the integer `k` and the total number of possible integers `n`.

The current function `priority_v0` always returns 0.0, which means no priority is given to any integer.

The improved version `priority_v1` is not yet implemented. However, I can provide a simple example of how you might improve this function. For instance, you could give higher priority to larger numbers, assuming that larger numbers are more likely to lead to large SS progressions. Here's a simple way to do that:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`. Gives higher priority to larger numbers."""
  return k / n
```

This function returns a value between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates the highest priority (for the largest number) and 0 indicates the lowest priority (for the smallest number).
