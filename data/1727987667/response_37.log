To improve the `priority_v0` function over the `priority_v1` and `priority_v2` methods, we can consider the following approach:

1. Calculate the sum of the digits of the integer `k`.
2. Calculate the number of even digits in `k`.
3. Calculate the number of odd digits in `k`.
4. Use these calculations to determine a priority score for `k`.

Here's an implementation of the `priority_v1` function based on this approach:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
    # Calculate the sum of the digits of k
    digit_sum = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(k))

    # Calculate the number of even digits in k
    even_digits = sum(1 for digit in str(k) if int(digit) % 2 == 0)

    # Calculate the number of odd digits in k
    odd_digits = len(str(k)) - even_digits

    # Determine the priority score based on the calculations
    priority = digit_sum + even_digits - odd_digits

    return priority
```

This implementation uses the sum of the digits, the number of even digits, and the number of odd digits to determine the priority score. The priority score is calculated as the sum of the digits plus the number of even digits minus the number of odd digits.

You can further improve the `priority_v2` function by considering additional factors or using more advanced techniques to calculate the priority score.
