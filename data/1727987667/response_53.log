The provided code defines a function `priority_v0` that takes two integer arguments `k` and `n`, and always returns 0.0 as the priority. The task is to improve this function to create a more meaningful priority calculation for adding an integer `k` to the Salem-Spencer set, given the total number of possible integers `n`.

Here's an improved version of the function `priority_v1` that calculates the priority based on the frequency of the integer `k` in the Salem-Spencer set:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int, salem_spencer_set: set) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`. Calculates the priority based on the frequency of `k` in the Salem-Spencer set."""
    return (n - len(salem_spencer_set)) / n if k not in salem_spencer_set else 0.0
```

In this version, the priority is calculated as the ratio of the remaining possible integers that are not in the Salem-Spencer set to the total number of possible integers `n`. If the integer `k` is already in the Salem-Spencer set, the priority is 0.0.
