It seems like you're working on a function called `priority_v1` which is intended to be an improvement over a previous function `priority_v0`.

However, the provided code for `priority_v1` is incomplete. It's currently just a declaration of the function with a comment about its purpose.

Given that the function is supposed to return a priority value based on the inputs `k` and `n`, I can provide a basic example of how you might implement this. This is a very simple example and may not be the most efficient or optimal solution, but it should give you a starting point.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`. Returns a priority value based on `k` and `n`.

    In this example, the priority is calculated as a ratio of `k` to `n`.
    """
    if n == 0:
        return 0.0  # Avoid division by zero
    else:
        return k / n
```

This function checks if `n` is zero to avoid a division by zero error, and then calculates the priority as the ratio of `k` to `n`.
