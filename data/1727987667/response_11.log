It seems there's a bit of confusion in your request. The function `priority_v0` and `priority_v1` take two arguments `k` and `n`, but you're describing the problem in terms of an `element` that's not defined in the function signature.

Assuming `k` is the element you're referring to, and `n` is the size of the set of possible integers, one way to improve the `priority_v0` function could be to prioritize larger numbers, as they might lead to more significant progressions. Here's a simple way to do this:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`. Prioritizes larger numbers."""
  return k / n
```

This function will return a value between 0 and 1, with larger numbers having a higher priority.

As for `priority_v2`, it's not clear what improvements you're looking for without more context. Could you please provide more details?
