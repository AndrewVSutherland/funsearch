The given code is a template for a function that calculates a priority score for a given integer `k` out of a set of `n` possible integers. The initial version of the function, `priority_v0`, simply returns 0.0 for all inputs. The task is to improve this function in small steps, creating a new version `priority_v1` that provides a more meaningful priority score.

Here's a potential improvement for `priority_v1`:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`.

  This version returns a priority score based on the proportion of the total number of integers
  that `k` represents. This could be useful in scenarios where larger numbers are more desirable
  or when the total range of possible integers is known and we want to prioritize the numbers
  that are closer to the middle of the range.
  """
  return k / n
```

In this version of the function, the priority score is calculated as the ratio of the given integer `k` to the total number of possible integers `n`. This means that numbers closer to the middle of the range (i.e., closer to `n/2`) will have higher priority scores, while numbers closer to the edges of the range will have lower priority scores.
