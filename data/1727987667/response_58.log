Here's an improved version of the function, `priority_v1`, which takes into account the absolute value of the difference between `k` and the previous elements in the Salem-Spencer set. This is because larger differences between elements can lead to larger progressions.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int, ss_set: set) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`.
    This version considers the absolute difference between `k` and the elements in the Salem-Spencer set.
    """
    if not ss_set:
        return 1.0  # If the set is empty, `k` is the first element and has maximum priority
    else:
        return 1 / (1 + np.min([abs(k - s) for s in ss_set]))
```

In this version, the priority is inversely proportional to the smallest absolute difference between `k` and the elements in the Salem-Spencer set. If `k` is far from all elements in the set, its priority will be high. If `k` is close to some element in the set, its priority will be low.

This approach assumes that larger gaps between elements lead to larger progressions and therefore are more desirable. However, this might not always be the case, and other considerations might need to be taken into account.
