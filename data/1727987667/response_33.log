Sure, I'd be happy to help you improve your code. The `priority_v2` function is currently incomplete, so I'll focus on that.

Here's a simple improvement to `priority_v1` that might be what you're looking for. This version prioritizes larger numbers more, but it also gives a slight bonus to numbers that are close to the square root of `n`, as these numbers are likely to form part of a progression with other numbers in the set.

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v1`. Prioritizes larger numbers and numbers close to sqrt(n)."""
  sqrt_n = np.sqrt(n)
  return k / n + np.exp(-((k - sqrt_n) / sqrt_n) ** 2)
```

In this version, the priority is calculated as the sum of two components: `k / n`, which is the same as in `priority_v1`, and `np.exp(-((k - sqrt_n) / sqrt_n) ** 2)`, which is a Gaussian distribution centered at `sqrt(n)`. This second component gives a higher priority to numbers close to `sqrt(n)`.
