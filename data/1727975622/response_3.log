Here is an improved version of `priority_v0` that takes into account the size of the gap between `k` and the largest number already in the Salem-Spencer set. The larger the gap, the higher the priority.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, ss_set: list) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`.
  `ss_set` is the current Salem-Spencer set.
  """
  if not ss_set:  # If the set is empty, any number has the highest priority
    return float('inf')
  max_in_set = max(ss_set)
  gap = k - max_in_set
  return gap if gap > 0 else 0.0  # The larger the gap, the higher the priority
```

This function works by first checking if the Salem-Spencer set is empty. If it is, this means that any number has the highest priority, so the function returns infinity. If the set is not empty, the function finds the largest number in the set and calculates the gap between `k` and this number. If the gap is positive, this means that `k` is larger than all numbers in the set, so the function returns the gap as the priority. If the gap is not positive (i.e., `k` is smaller than or equal to the largest number in the set), the function returns 0, indicating that `k` has the lowest priority.
