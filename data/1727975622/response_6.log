Below is the improved version of `priority_v0` method named `priority_v1`. This version considers the frequency of the number `k` in the range from 1 to `n` and the size of the number `k` itself. The higher the frequency and the smaller the size, the higher the priority.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  # Calculate the frequency of the number k in the range from 1 to n
  frequency = np.sum([1 for i in range(1, n + 1) if k in str(i)]) / n

  # Calculate the size of the number k
  size = len(str(k))

  # The priority is the inverse of the size multiplied by the frequency
  priority = frequency / size

  return priority
```
This version of the function calculates the priority by dividing the frequency of `k` in the range from 1 to `n` by the size of `k`. The smaller `k` is, the higher its priority, and the more frequently `k` appears in the range from 1 to `n`, the higher its priority.
