Here is an improved version of `priority_v0` that prioritizes larger numbers and numbers that are further apart.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int, ss_set: set) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`.
  The priority is calculated as the sum of the differences between `k` and all the elements in the current Salem-Spencer set `ss_set`.
  A larger sum indicates a larger average difference, which means `k` is further apart from the elements in `ss_set`,
  and therefore has a higher priority.
  Additionally, `k` is multiplied by a factor of `n` to prioritize larger numbers.
  """
  return k * n + sum(abs(k - ss) for ss in ss_set)
```

This function makes the assumption that the `ss_set` is passed in as an argument. This set contains the elements that have already been added to the Salem-Spencer set. The priority of `k` is calculated as the sum of the differences between `k` and all the elements in `ss_set`. A larger sum indicates a larger average difference, which means `k` is further apart from the elements in `ss_set`, and therefore has a higher priority. Additionally, `k` is multiplied by a factor of `n` to prioritize larger numbers.
