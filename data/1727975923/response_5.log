To improve the `priority_v0` function, we can consider the following changes:

1. Use the integer `k` and the total number of possible integers `n` to calculate a priority score.
2. One possible approach could be to give higher priority to smaller integers, as they have more potential for forming larger progressions.
3. We can also take into account the ratio of `k` to `n` to determine the priority.

Here's an improved version of the `priority_v1` function:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  # Give higher priority to smaller integers
  # Calculate the ratio of k to n
  ratio = k / n

  # Use an inverse exponential function to determine the priority
  priority = np.exp(-ratio)

  return priority
```

In this version, smaller integers are given higher priority, as they have a higher potential for forming larger progressions. The priority is calculated using an inverse exponential function, which gives higher priority to smaller ratios.

Note that the `np.exp` function is used to calculate the exponential of the ratio, and `numpy` is imported at the beginning of the code.
