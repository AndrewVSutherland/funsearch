The improved version of `priority_v0` could consider the number of divisors of `k` and use it as a priority score. The more divisors a number has, the higher its priority for being added to the Salem-Spencer set.

Here's an implementation using the `numpy` library to efficiently calculate the number of divisors:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`.

  Args:
      k: The integer to determine the priority for.
      n: The number of possible integers.

  Returns:
      The priority with which we want to add `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.
  """
  # Calculate the number of divisors of k
  num_divisors = np.sum(k % np.arange(1, k + 1) == 0)

  # Normalize the number of divisors by dividing by k (to keep the priority within [0, 1])
  priority = num_divisors / k

  return priority
```

This function first calculates the number of divisors of `k` by checking how many numbers in the range from 1 to `k` evenly divide `k`. It then normalizes this count by dividing it by `k` to ensure that the priority remains within the range [0, 1].
