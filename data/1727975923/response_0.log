Here's an improved version of the `priority_v0` function, named `priority_v1`:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  if k < 2:
    return 0.0
  elif k > n / 2:
    return 1.0
  else:
    return k / (n / 2)
```

This version prioritizes integers that are larger than 1 and smaller than half of `n`. The priority is calculated as the ratio of `k` to half of `n`. This way, the larger `k` is, the higher its priority will be. Integers that are too small or too large are given the lowest and highest priorities, respectively.
