```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  # Calculate the frequency of k in the range of possible integers
  frequency = np.count_nonzero(np.arange(n) % k == 0) / n

  # Prioritize numbers with higher frequency
  return frequency
```
The `priority_v1` function calculates the frequency of `k` in the range of possible integers `n` by counting the number of multiples of `k` in the range `0` to `n-1` and dividing it by `n`. This frequency is then used as the priority score for `k` in the Salem-Spencer set.
