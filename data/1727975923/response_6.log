It seems like there's a bit of confusion in your request. The function `priority_v1` is defined but not yet implemented. I'd be happy to help improve the `priority_v1` function based on the description of `priority_v0`. However, I'll need more information about the specific problem you're trying to solve or the context of the code.

From the comments of the functions, it seems that we're working with Salem-Spencer sets and trying to determine the priority of adding an integer `k` to the set. The priority is based on the total number of possible integers `n`.

Without more specifics, it's difficult to suggest an improvement to `priority_v1`. However, a simple modification could be to return a score based on how close `k` is to the middle of the range `[1, ..., n]`. Here's a simple example:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Returns a priority score based on how close k is to the middle of the range."""
  middle = n / 2
  return 1 / (abs(k - middle) + 1)  # the closer k is to the middle, the higher the priority
```

This function calculates the absolute difference between `k` and the middle of the range, adds 1 to avoid division by zero, and then takes the reciprocal. This ensures that the priority is highest for `k` values close to the middle of the range.
