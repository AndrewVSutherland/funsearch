The `priority_v1` function is expected to improve upon the `priority_v0` function by returning a more appropriate priority value for adding a given integer `k` to the Salem-Spencer set. However, the current implementation of `priority_v1` is empty and does not contain any code.

To improve the `priority_v1` function, we can consider the following approach:

1. Calculate the difference between the given integer `k` and the previous integer added to the Salem-Spencer set.
2. Assign a priority score based on the difference calculated in step 1.
   - A larger difference might indicate a more significant progression, so we can assign a higher priority score.
   - Conversely, a smaller difference might indicate less progression, so we can assign a lower priority score.
3. Return the priority score calculated in step 2.

Here's an implementation of `priority_v1` based on the above approach:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int, prev_k: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
    difference = abs(k - prev_k)
    priority_score = 1 / difference if difference != 0 else float('inf')
    return priority_score
```

In this implementation, `prev_k` represents the previous integer added to the Salem-Spencer set. This function calculates the absolute difference between `k` and `prev_k` and assigns a priority score based on the inverse of the difference. If the difference is zero, we assign an infinite priority score to handle the case where `k` is the same as the previous integer.
