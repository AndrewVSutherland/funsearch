It seems like you're working on a project that involves finding large progressions in Salem-Spencer sets. The function `priority_v1` is an improved version of `priority_v0`, and it receives two parameters: `k`, an integer for which we want to determine priority, and `n`, the number of possible integers.

Unfortunately, the code for `priority_v1` is not provided. Could you please provide the code or a description of the improvements you're planning to make? This will help me understand the task better and provide an appropriate solution.
