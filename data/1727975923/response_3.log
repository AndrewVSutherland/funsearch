The problem statement asks to improve upon a function that calculates the priority of adding an integer to the Salem-Spencer set. The function takes two arguments: `k`, the integer we want to determine the priority for, and `n`, the total number of possible integers. The function `priority_v0` currently returns 0.0 for all inputs. We need to improve upon this function to return a meaningful priority value.

Here is a simple improvement:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  return k / n
```

This improvement returns the ratio of `k` to `n` as the priority. This means that larger numbers (closer to `n`) have a higher priority. This is a simple and logical improvement, but it may not be the best possible solution depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem.
