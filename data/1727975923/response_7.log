It appears that you're looking to implement a function that calculates the priority of a given integer `k` to be added to a Salem-Spencer set, where `n` is the total number of possible integers. In this context, the `priority_v1` function is supposed to be an improved version of the `priority_v0` function. However, the `priority_v1` function is currently not defined.

Without specific information about the criteria for improvement or the context of the problem, it's hard to provide a concrete implementation for the `priority_v1` function.

However, let's assume a simple improvement could be to give higher priority to larger numbers, as they may contribute more to the set's properties. Here's a simple implementation:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """An improved version of `priority_v0`. Gives higher priority to larger numbers."""
  return k / n
```

This function calculates the priority of a number `k` by dividing it by the total number of possible integers `n`. This way, larger numbers will have a higher priority.
