Here's an improved version of `priority_v0` that takes into account both the magnitude and frequency of the integer `k` within the range of possible integers `n`.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  frequency = np.bincount(np.arange(n))[k] / n  # calculate the frequency of k in the range [0, n)
  magnitude = k / n  # calculate the magnitude of k in the range [0, n)
  return magnitude * (1 - frequency)  # return a priority that favors large numbers with low frequency
```

In this version, we calculate the frequency of `k` in the range `[0, n)` by dividing the count of `k` in this range by `n`. We also calculate the magnitude of `k` in the same range by dividing `k` by `n`. Finally, we return a priority that favors large numbers with low frequency by multiplying the magnitude by `(1 - frequency)`. This way, we prioritize adding integers that are large and unique to the Salem-Spencer set.
