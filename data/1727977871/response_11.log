Here's an improved version of `priority_v0`:

```python
@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Returns the priority with which we want to add `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.
  `n` is the number of possible integers, and `k` is the integer we want to determine priority for.
  """
  # Priority is inversely proportional to the integer's value
  # This means that smaller numbers get higher priority
  return 1 / k if k != 0 else 0
```

This version of the function calculates the priority as the reciprocal of `k`. This means that smaller values of `k` will have a higher priority, which might make more sense in the context of the problem. We also handle the case where `k` is zero to avoid a division by zero error.
