Here's a possible implementation of `priority_v1`:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`.
  This version of the priority function gives higher priority to numbers
  that are closer to the middle of the range of possible integers.
  """
  mid = n / 2
  return 1.0 - abs(k - mid) / mid
```

This version of the priority function gives higher priority to numbers that are closer to the middle of the range of possible integers. This is based on the assumption that numbers closer to the middle are more likely to be part of large SS progressions.
