The function `priority_v1` is an improved version of `priority_v0`. However, the code for `priority_v1` is not provided. I will assume that the improvement might be based on the mathematical concept of Salem-Spencer set, which is a set of positive integers with certain properties related to their pairwise sums and differences.

A common way to prioritize adding an integer `k` to the Salem-Spencer set is to calculate the ratio of the number of distinct pairwise sums and differences that `k` would add to the set, to the total number of possible pairwise sums and differences. This ratio can be a good measure of the "usefulness" of `k` to the set.

Here is a possible implementation of `priority_v1` based on this idea:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int, ss_set: set) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`.
    ss_set is the current Salem-Spencer set.
    """
    # Calculate the pairwise sums and differences that k would add to the set
    new_sums = {k + s for s in ss_set}
    new_diffs = {abs(k - s) for s in ss_set}

    # Calculate the number of distinct sums and differences in the new set
    distinct_sums = len(set.union(ss_set, new_sums))
    distinct_diffs = len(set.union(ss_set, new_diffs))

    # Calculate the total number of possible sums and differences
    total_pairs = n * (n + 1) // 2

    # Calculate the priority as the ratio of the number of distinct sums and differences
    # that k would add to the set, to the total number of possible sums and differences
    priority = (distinct_sums + distinct_diffs - len(ss_set)) / total_pairs

    return priority
```

This implementation calculates the priority of adding `k` to the Salem-Spencer set `ss_set`, where `n` is the number of possible integers. The priority is calculated as the ratio of the number of distinct pairwise sums and differences that `k` would add to the set, to the total number of possible pairwise sums and differences.
