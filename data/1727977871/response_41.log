It seems like there's a mistake in your message. Both `priority_v1` and `priority_v2` are exactly the same, which is not what you wanted. I'll correct it by improving `priority_v2` over `priority_v1`.

The code in `priority_v1` calculates the number of unique prime factors of `k` and divides it by the natural logarithm of `n`. A possible improvement could be to square the count of unique prime factors, as this might give more weight to elements with more distinct prime factors.

Here's the improved version:

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v1`."""
  def prime_factors(n):
    i = 2
    factors = set()
    while i * i <= n:
      if n % i:
        i += 1
      else:
        n //= i
        factors.add(i)
    if n > 1:
      factors.add(n)
    return factors

  return (len(prime_factors(k)) ** 2) / np.log(n)
```

In this version, `(len(prime_factors(k)) ** 2)` gives more weight to elements with more distinct prime factors, which might be beneficial for finding large SS progressions.
