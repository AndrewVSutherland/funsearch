Returns the priority with which we want to add `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.
`n` is the number of possible integers, and `k` is the integer we want to determine priority for.

In this improved version, we consider the following factors:

1. The inverse of the integer's value, so that smaller numbers get a higher priority.
2. The number of unique prime factors of the integer, as numbers with more unique prime factors are more likely to form a progression with other numbers.
3. The number of times the integer appears in the first `n` numbers of the Fibonacci sequence, as Fibonacci numbers are more likely to be in a progression.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  # Factorize the integer into prime factors
  factors = [i for i in range(2, k + 1) if k % i == 0]
  unique_factors = set(factors)

  # Count the number of times the integer appears in the first n numbers of the Fibonacci sequence
  fib_count = sum(1 for x in fibonacci(n) if x == k)

  # Calculate the priority
  priority = (1 / k) * len(unique_factors) * (1 + fib_count)
  return priority

def fibonacci(n):
  # Generator for the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence
  a, b = 0, 1
  for _ in range(n):
    yield a
    a, b = b, a + b
```

This implementation should provide a more accurate estimate of the priority for adding each integer to the Salem-Spencer set.
