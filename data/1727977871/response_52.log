Sure, I'd be happy to help you improve this code. However, I need more context to provide a meaningful improvement.

The current code defines a function `priority_v0` that always returns 0.0, and two other functions `priority_v1` and `priority_v2` that do the same but are intended to be improved versions of `priority_v0`.

Without knowing the specific requirements or the context in which these functions will be used, it's difficult for me to suggest a meaningful improvement.

However, I can suggest a generic improvement based on common practice. If the goal is to prioritize larger integers, you could return `k` itself as the priority, which would mean that larger integers have a higher priority. Here's how you could modify `priority_v1` to do this:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`. Prioritizes larger integers."""
  return float(k)
```

This would mean that the integer with the highest value would be added to the Salem-Spencer set first.
