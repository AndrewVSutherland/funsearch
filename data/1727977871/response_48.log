In the `priority_v2` function, we can further improve the priority calculation by considering the frequency of each prime factor. Instead of just counting the number of unique prime factors, we can prioritize numbers with a larger product of the frequencies of their prime factors. This is because a number with more higher-frequency prime factors is more likely to have a larger sum-of-divisors progression.

Here's a possible implementation:

```python
from collections import Counter

def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v1`."""

  if k <= 1 or k > n:
    return 0.0

  # Count the frequency of each prime factor of k
  factors = []
  i = 2
  while i * i <= k:
    if k % i:
      i += 1
    else:
      k //= i
      factors.append(i)

  if k > 1:
    factors.append(k)

  # Calculate the product of the frequencies of the prime factors
  priority = 1
  for count in Counter(factors).values():
    priority *= count

  return priority
```

In this version, we use the `collections.Counter` class to count the frequency of each prime factor. Then, we calculate the product of these frequencies and return it as the priority. This should result in a better distribution of priority values, leading to more effective addition of elements to the Salem-Spencer set.
