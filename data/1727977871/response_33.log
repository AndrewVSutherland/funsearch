I have provided an improved version of the `priority_v0` function, named `priority_v1`. In this version, we calculate the priority based on the difference between `k` and `n/2`. The priority is highest when `k` is closest to `n/2`, and it decreases as `k` moves further away from `n/2`.

Here's the updated code:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`.

  Args:
    k: The integer for which we want to determine priority.
    n: The number of possible integers.

  Returns:
    The priority with which we want to add `k` to the salem-spencer set.
  """
  return 1 - abs(k - n / 2) / (n / 2)
```

Now, let's execute this code to see if it works as expected.
```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`.

  Args:
    k: The integer for which we want to determine priority.
    n: The number of possible integers.

  Returns:
    The priority with which we want to add `k` to the salem-spencer set.
  """
  return 1 - abs(k - n / 2) / (n / 2)

# Testing the function with sample inputs
print(priority_v1(5, 10))
print(priority_v1(8, 10))
print(priority_v1(3, 10))
```
