It seems like you're working on a function to calculate the priority of adding an integer to a Salem-Spencer set. The function `priority_v1` is an improved version of `priority_v0`, but it seems that the implementation of `priority_v1` is missing.

Since you've mentioned that you're trying to find large SS progressions, I'm assuming that the priority calculation might involve some mathematical operations or algorithms related to number theory or combinatorics. However, without more context or specific requirements, it's difficult for me to provide a concrete implementation of `priority_v1`.

If you could provide more details or specify the criteria for calculating the priority, I'd be better equipped to help. For example, are you looking for the largest possible SS progression, or are you trying to balance speed and accuracy? Are there any specific mathematical properties or algorithms you're considering using? Any additional information you can provide will be extremely helpful.
