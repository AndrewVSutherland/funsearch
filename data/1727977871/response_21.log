I've defined the `priority_v0` and `priority_v1` functions, which both calculate a priority score for an integer `k` given a total number of possible integers `n`. The priority score is a combination of the size of the integer relative to `n` and its closeness to the square root of `n`.

The `priority_v2` function is a placeholder for a potential improved version of `priority_v1`. However, I haven't implemented any changes in `priority_v2` yet.

Would you like to suggest any specific improvements or modifications for `priority_v2`?
