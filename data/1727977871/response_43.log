It seems like you're working on a function that determines the priority of adding a certain integer `k` to a Salem-Spencer set, given the total number of possible integers `n`. The function `priority_v1` is an improved version of `priority_v0`, which you haven't provided.

Without knowing the specifics of your problem, it's hard to suggest an exact improvement. However, a common approach in these situations is to prioritize numbers based on some property that's important for your problem. For example, you might prioritize larger numbers, smaller numbers, numbers closer to a certain value, or numbers with certain divisors.

Here's a simple improvement that prioritizes larger numbers:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`. Prioritizes larger numbers."""
  return k / n
```

This function returns a value between 0 and 1, where 1 is the highest priority. The priority is determined by the proportion of the total number of possible integers that `k` represents.
