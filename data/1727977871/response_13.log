Here's an improved version of `priority_v0`:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Returns the priority for integer k out of n possible integers.

  The priority is determined by the size of k relative to n, with larger numbers having higher priority.
  """
  return k / n
```

This version of the function calculates the priority as a proportion of the integer `k` to the total number of possible integers `n`. Larger numbers have a higher priority because they are further from zero and therefore have more potential to contribute to large SS progressions.
