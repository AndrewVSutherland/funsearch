Here's an improved version of `priority_v0` that gives higher priority to larger numbers and numbers closer to the square root of `n`. This is based on the assumption that larger numbers and numbers closer to the square root of `n` are more likely to lead to large SS progressions.

```python
import math

def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  return k / n + (1 - abs(k - math.sqrt(n)) / math.sqrt(n))
```

In this version, the priority is a weighted sum of two components. The first component is `k / n`, which gives higher priority to larger numbers. The second component is `(1 - abs(k - math.sqrt(n)) / math.sqrt(n))`, which gives higher priority to numbers closer to the square root of `n`. The absolute difference between `k` and the square root of `n` is normalized by dividing by the square root of `n`, so that the second component is always between 0 and 1. The two components are then added together, with equal weight.
