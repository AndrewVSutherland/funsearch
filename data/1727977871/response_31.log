To improve over the `priority_v0` function, we can start by considering the properties of the Salem-Spencer set and the integer `k`. Since the Salem-Spencer set is a sequence of positive integers with certain properties related to squarefree numbers, we can use this information to assign a priority to each integer `k`.

One way to improve the priority function is to consider the squarefree nature of the integers in the Salem-Spencer set. A squarefree number is a positive integer that has no square divisors other than 1. We can assign a higher priority to squarefree numbers since they are more likely to be included in the Salem-Spencer set.

Here's an improved version of the `priority_v1` function:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  if is_squarefree(k):
    return 1.0
  else:
    return 0.0

def is_squarefree(n: int) -> bool:
  """Check if a number is squarefree."""
  i = 2
  while i * i <= n:
    if n % (i * i) == 0:
      return False
    i += 1
  return True
```

In this version, the `is_squarefree` function checks if a number `n` is squarefree. The `priority_v1` function then assigns a priority of 1.0 to squarefree numbers and a priority of 0.0 to non-squarefree numbers. This simple modification should improve the function's ability to identify integers that are likely to be included in the Salem-Spencer set.
