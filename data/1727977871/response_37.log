It seems like there is a missing part of the code in your question. However, I can still help you improve the `priority_v1` function based on the context provided. Here's a possible improvement:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  # Prioritize larger numbers
  return k / n
```

This version of the function prioritizes larger numbers by returning a value between 0 and 1, where 1 represents the highest priority. This might be useful if you're looking for large SS progressions, as it will give higher priority to larger numbers.
