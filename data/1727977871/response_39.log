The `priority_v2` function is missing an implementation. To improve upon `priority_v1`, we could consider the distribution of numbers and their appearances in sequences. Since we're looking for large SS progressions, it might be beneficial to prioritize numbers that appear more frequently in such sequences. However, without additional context or a more specific problem statement, it's difficult to propose a concrete improvement.

Here's a placeholder implementation that you can modify based on your further insights:

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v1`.
  This is a placeholder function and needs to be modified based on the problem context.
  """
  # Placeholder implementation
  # For example, if `k` is a common number in SS progressions, it might be prioritized
  common_ss_numbers = [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]  # This is an example and should be replaced with actual data
  if k in common_ss_numbers:
      return k / n * 1.1  # Slightly increase the priority for common SS numbers
  else:
      return k / n
```
