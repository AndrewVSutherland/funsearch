It seems like you're working on a function to determine the priority of adding an integer to a Salem-Spencer set. This function should take two arguments: the integer `k` and the total number of possible integers `n`.

The current function `priority_v0` always returns 0.0, which means no priority is given to any integer.

The task is to improve this function in small steps. The improved function should be named `priority_v1`.

Here's a simple improvement: we can prioritize larger numbers, assuming that larger numbers might contribute more to the progression. We can do this by returning `k` as the priority. This way, larger numbers will have a higher priority.

Here's how we can implement this:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`. Prioritizes larger numbers."""
  return float(k)
```

This implementation will prioritize larger numbers, but the priority values will be very large for larger `k`, which might cause problems. To mitigate this, we can normalize the priority value by dividing it by `n`. This will ensure that the priority value is between 0 and 1, regardless of the size of `k` and `n`.

Here's the improved version of `priority_v1` with normalization:

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`. Prioritizes larger numbers and normalizes the priority value."""
  return float(k) / n
```

This function will now return a priority value between 0 and 1 that increases with `k`, giving a higher priority to larger numbers. It also ensures that the priority value is within a reasonable range, even for large `k` and `n`.
