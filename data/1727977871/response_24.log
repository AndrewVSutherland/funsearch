Here's an improved version of `priority_v0` that takes into account the distance of `k` from the center of the range of possible integers and the number of factors of `k`. The more factors `k` has, the higher its priority.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  center = n / 2
  distance_from_center = abs(k - center)
  num_factors = sum(2 for i in range(1, k + 1) if k % i == 0)
  return num_factors / distance_from_center
```

This version of the function gives a higher priority to numbers that are closer to the center of the range and have more factors. The priority is calculated as the number of factors divided by the distance from the center, which favors numbers with many factors that are close to the center of the range.
