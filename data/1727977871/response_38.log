Your original code is already quite concise and the improvements you've made to `priority_v0` and `priority_v1` are clear. However, it seems that you're missing the implementation for `priority_v2`. Here's a suggestion for an improvement over `priority_v1`, using a logarithmic scale:

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v1` using logarithmic scale."""
  return np.log(k + 1) / np.log(n + 1)
```

This version of the function uses the natural logarithm (`np.log`) instead of the raw values of `k` and `n`. This can help to better distinguish between small and large numbers, which might be useful in your context. The `+ 1` in the arguments of the logarithm functions is to avoid taking the logarithm of zero, which is undefined.
