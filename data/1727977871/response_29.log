Here's how `priority_v2` could be implemented:

```python
def priority_v2(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v1`."""
  # Prioritize larger numbers, numbers close to sqrt(n), and numbers that are close to the middle of the range
  mid = n / 2
  return k / n + (1 / abs(k - np.sqrt(n))) + (1 / abs(k - mid))
```

In this version, I've added a term to the priority that favors numbers close to the middle of the range. This should help to encourage the formation of arithmetic progressions where possible.
