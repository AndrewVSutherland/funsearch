Sure, I'd be happy to help improve your code. Here's a simple way to modify `priority_v1` to consider the size of `k` and `n`. The priority could be inversely proportional to `k` and directly proportional to `n`. This means that smaller `k` values (closer to zero) and larger `n` values (further from the total number of possible integers) will have higher priorities.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int, total_n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  return (total_n - n) / (k + 1)  # Add 1 to avoid division by zero
```

In this version, `total_n` is the total number of possible integers. The `(total_n - n)` term increases the priority as `n` approaches `total_n`, and the `(k + 1)` term decreases the priority as `k` approaches zero.
