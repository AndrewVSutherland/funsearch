Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the Salem-Spencer set and the number of possible integers `n`. This version uses a simple heuristic: the priority is higher for less frequent elements and for elements closer to the middle of the range.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int, ss_set: set) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  freq = sum(1 for x in ss_set if x == k)  # Frequency of k in the SS set
  return (n - k) / (n + 1) - freq / (n + 1)  # Priority is higher for less frequent elements and elements closer to the middle
```

To use this function in the `funsearch` loop, you can modify the `@funsearch.run` decorator to pass the current `ss_set` to `priority_v1`:

```python
@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int, ss_set: set) -> float:
  """Returns the priority with which we want to add `k` to the salem-spencer set."""
  freq = sum(1 for x in ss_set if x == k)
  return (n - k) / (n + 1) - freq / (n + 1)
```

With this change, `funsearch` will automatically pass the current `ss_set` to `priority_v1` on each iteration.
