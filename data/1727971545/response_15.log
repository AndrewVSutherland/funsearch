Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[0, n-1]` and the number of remaining possible integers. This version uses the `itertools` library to generate all possible integers in the given range.

```python
from collections import Counter

@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
    # Generate all possible integers in the range [0, n-1]
    possible_integers = list(range(n))

    # Count the frequency of `k` in the possible integers
    freq_k = possible_integers.count(k)

    # Calculate the priority as the frequency of `k` divided by the number of remaining possible integers
    priority = freq_k / (n - len(possible_integers))

    return priority
```

This version of `priority_v1` makes small changes to the previous version by adding the frequency calculation and using it to determine the priority. The code is also kept short by using the `count` method to find the frequency of `k` and dividing it by the number of remaining possible integers.
