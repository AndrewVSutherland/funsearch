Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the density of numbers around `k` in the range `[1, n]`. This version uses the harmonic series to estimate the density and adjusts the priority based on it.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Improved version of `priority_v0` using harmonic series for density estimation."""
    density = n / (np.log(n) + np.euler_gamma)  # Estimate density using harmonic series
    return density * (n - k)  # Prioritize numbers closer to n
```

This version makes a small change by estimating the density of numbers around `k` and using it to adjust the priority. The harmonic series is used as an approximation for the density, and the priority is increased for numbers closer to `n`. This change should improve the performance of the Salem-Spencer set construction.

To further improve the priority function, you could consider additional factors such as the distribution of prime numbers, the behavior of the MÃ¶bius function, or the growth rate of the Salem-Spencer set itself. However, keep in mind that making only small changes and keeping the code short, as specified in the problem description.
