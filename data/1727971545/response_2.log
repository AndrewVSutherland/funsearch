Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[0, n)` and the number of unique elements in that range. This version is shorter and makes a small change from `priority_v0`.

```python
from collections import Counter

@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
    """Returns the priority with which we want to add `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.
    n is the number of possible integers, and k is the integer we want to determine priority for.
    """
    # Count the frequency of each integer in the range [0, n)
    freq = Counter(range(n))
    # Calculate priority as the frequency of k divided by the number of unique elements
    return freq[k] / len(freq)
```

This version of `priority_v1` uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each integer in the range `[0, n)`. The priority is then calculated as the frequency of `k` divided by the number of unique elements in the range. This should provide a better measure of the priority for adding `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.
