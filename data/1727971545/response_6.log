Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the frequency of `k` in the range `[1, n]` and the number of elements in the Salem-Spencer set. This version uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of `k`.

```python
from collections import Counter

def priority_v1(k: int, n: int, ss_set: set) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  freq = sum(1 for i in range(1, n + 1) if i % k == 0)
  return freq / (n + 1 - len(ss_set))
```

This version assumes that `ss_set` is the current Salem-Spencer set, and it calculates the priority as the ratio of the frequency of `k` to the number of remaining possible integers to add to the set. This should help improve the search process by giving higher priority to elements that are more frequent and have fewer duplicates already in the set.

To use this function with `funsearch.run`, you can modify the decorator like this:

```python
@funsearch.run
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int, ss_set: set = None) -> float:
  if ss_set is None:
    ss_set = set()
  return priority_v1(k, n, ss_set)
```

This way, `funsearch` will pass the current `ss_set` to the `priority_v1` function on each iteration.
