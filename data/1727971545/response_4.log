Here's an improved version of `priority_v1` that considers the number of unique remainders when dividing `k` by `n`, and the number of multiples of `k` within the range `[0, n)`. This version is shorter and makes small changes to `priority_v0`.

```python
def priority_v1(k: int, n: int) -> float:
  """Improved version of `priority_v0`."""
  remainders = set(k % i for i in range(1, n + 1))
  multiples = sum(i for i in range(0, n) if i % k == 0)
  return len(remainders) + multiples
```

This version of `priority_v1` calculates the priority by adding the number of unique remainders when dividing `k` by all integers from 1 to `n`, and the number of multiples of `k` within the range `[0, n)`. This should provide a better estimate of the priority for adding `k` to the Salem-Spencer set.
